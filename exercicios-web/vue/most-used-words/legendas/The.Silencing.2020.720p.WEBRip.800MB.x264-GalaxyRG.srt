2
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,040
That's mine.

3
00:03:03,942 --> 00:03:06,079
Well, I saw it first, shithead.

4
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:12,518
Well, actually,
the deer's mine.

5
00:03:12,552 --> 00:03:14,886
And you two shitheads
are trespassing.

6
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,289
Come on, Rayburn.

7
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:17,956
You ain't going to miss
one buck.

8
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,292
It's a goddamn zoo
around here.

9
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:20,926
Well, that's the point.

10
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,861
This is a sanctuary,
you dumbshit.

11
00:03:22,894 --> 00:03:24,297
Now, put down your rifles.

12
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,498
Okay.

13
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:30,303
Rayburn Swanson
is a goddamn tree hugger.

14
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:32,071
Who'd have thought?

15
00:03:32,105 --> 00:03:33,306
Well, people change.

16
00:03:34,574 --> 00:03:36,142
No, they don't.

17
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,955
You can pick up
your guns later.

18
00:03:49,988 --> 00:03:51,790
Don't let me catch you
here again, all right?

19
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:18,518
Don't suppose you boys
could give me a jump?

20
00:05:08,067 --> 00:05:09,335
Hey, Thor.

21
00:05:12,338 --> 00:05:14,340
How you doing, huh?
Are you tired?

22
00:05:20,313 --> 00:05:22,181
Any more activity?

23
00:05:28,388 --> 00:05:30,490
Weren't you supposed
to do the dishes?

24
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:43,136
<i>A defunct paper
mill on Sawbill Reservation</i>

25
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:45,937
<i>is now ground zero
for the war on drugs.</i>

26
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,973
<i>The locals call it
the Factory.</i>

27
00:05:48,006 --> 00:05:51,344
<i>Sawbill Nation unanimously
voted last night</i>

28
00:05:51,377 --> 00:05:54,213
<i>to condemn the old paper mill
next month.</i>

29
00:05:54,247 --> 00:05:56,716
<i>Karl Blackhawk
is with the tribal police</i>

30
00:05:56,749 --> 00:05:59,419
<i>and has been working
diligently...</i>

31
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:13,633
Where'd you find him this time?

32
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,168
Over at the Factory.

33
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:18,003
Attracts trouble
from all sides, Alice.

34
00:06:18,036 --> 00:06:22,408
Trying to clean that place up,
but... losing battle, I guess.

35
00:06:22,442 --> 00:06:25,010
He's got blood on him.

36
00:06:25,043 --> 00:06:26,479
What happened?

37
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:28,080
According to him, nothin'.

38
00:06:28,114 --> 00:06:29,449
Just tripped.

39
00:06:29,482 --> 00:06:32,218
Any trouble around town
last night?

40
00:06:32,251 --> 00:06:34,019
Don't recall a time
there wasn't, Alice.

41
00:06:34,053 --> 00:06:36,021
Anything involving him?

42
00:06:36,055 --> 00:06:37,457
Not that I know of.

43
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,392
But I wouldn't, uh...

44
00:06:39,425 --> 00:06:40,760
I wouldn't bet on it.

45
00:06:40,793 --> 00:06:42,395
Thanks, Karl.
I'll take him home.

46
00:06:42,428 --> 00:06:44,029
Mm-hm.

47
00:06:44,063 --> 00:06:46,232
I can't keep doing you favors,
Alice.

48
00:06:46,265 --> 00:06:48,534
Sooner or later your brother's
gonna get caught up in something

49
00:06:48,568 --> 00:06:50,403
you won't be able
to get him out of.

50
00:06:55,441 --> 00:06:57,276
Come on. Get out.

51
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:11,123
What were you doing in that
place last night, Brooks?

52
00:07:12,725 --> 00:07:14,293
None of your business.

53
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:17,129
You still taking your meds?

54
00:07:17,163 --> 00:07:18,531
Every day.

55
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:20,633
Can you...?

56
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,368
Can you stop that, please?

57
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:28,708
Whose blood is that
on your shirt?

58
00:07:28,741 --> 00:07:30,776
Mostly mine.

59
00:07:32,445 --> 00:07:34,313
Sam Moonblood
beat the shit out of me.

60
00:07:34,347 --> 00:07:36,816
What? Why?

61
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:38,551
A woman.

62
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:40,353
Why don't you take
the back roads?

63
00:07:40,386 --> 00:07:41,754
What woman, Brooks?

64
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:48,261
You have any idea
what Moonblood does?

65
00:07:48,294 --> 00:07:50,530
Whatever it is, it's outside
of my jurisdiction.

66
00:07:50,563 --> 00:07:54,700
Him and that creepy fuck Olsen,
they push it all.

67
00:07:54,734 --> 00:07:56,769
Drugs. Gambling.

68
00:07:58,571 --> 00:08:00,473
Whoring.

69
00:08:00,506 --> 00:08:02,141
Were you paying for sex?

70
00:08:02,174 --> 00:08:03,676
Nah.

71
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:06,712
She wasn't a hooker.

72
00:08:06,746 --> 00:08:09,382
Can you just turn around
and take a different way home?

73
00:08:09,415 --> 00:08:10,850
- No, I need to go this way.
- I don't want to go this way.

74
00:08:10,883 --> 00:08:12,618
I gotta go this way,
I gotta do something.

75
00:08:12,652 --> 00:08:15,221
I don't want to go this
fucking way! Just turn around!

76
00:08:16,355 --> 00:08:18,090
Oh, shit, I...

77
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:21,527
Shit, I'm sorry, Brooks. I...

78
00:08:21,561 --> 00:08:22,728
I wasn't thinking.

79
00:08:42,615 --> 00:08:44,517
Still think you're cut out
for this?

80
00:08:46,686 --> 00:08:48,654
Don't think I forgot
what day it is.

81
00:08:48,688 --> 00:08:50,756
I'm gonna come by
the motel later.

82
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:54,360
I'm not sure I'll be around.

83
00:08:54,393 --> 00:08:56,195
Well, I'm gonna
come by anyway.

84
00:08:56,228 --> 00:08:58,197
<i>Unit one-three-one.</i>

85
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,132
Go for one-three-one.

86
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:03,369
<i>We've got a possible homicide
out on Buck Lake.</i>

87
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:07,173
Ten-four. I'm on my way.

88
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,255
Oh, shit.

89
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:28,361
Hey, kids.

90
00:09:28,394 --> 00:09:29,695
Thank you for having us,
Mr. Swanson.

91
00:09:29,729 --> 00:09:31,430
This is a real treat
for the students.

92
00:09:31,464 --> 00:09:33,933
Well, my pleasure, ma'am.

93
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:35,868
Are you intoxicated?

94
00:09:35,901 --> 00:09:38,304
Don't worry,
the kids won't notice.

95
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:43,809
Welcome to the Gwen Swanson
Wildlife Sanctuary.

96
00:09:43,843 --> 00:09:45,711
Now, who knows
what a sanctuary is?

97
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:48,848
No one?

98
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:53,586
Well, it's a place where no
trapping or hunting's allowed.

99
00:09:53,619 --> 00:09:57,323
A safe haven for animals.

100
00:09:57,356 --> 00:09:58,758
You see this area here?

101
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,560
Look, almost 50 square miles.

102
00:10:01,594 --> 00:10:03,596
That's my sanctuary.

103
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:07,333
My dad said you've killed
more animals than anyone.

104
00:10:07,366 --> 00:10:09,735
Used some real nasty traps too.

105
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:14,440
Done my share.
like everyone else around here.

106
00:10:15,675 --> 00:10:17,309
But I stopped all that.

107
00:10:17,343 --> 00:10:19,345
Why?

108
00:10:19,378 --> 00:10:21,447
My daughter didn't like it.

109
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,317
So now, instead of trapping
animals for their fur,

110
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:28,320
I use humane traps
to catch the problem ones,

111
00:10:28,354 --> 00:10:30,322
and then I release them here,

112
00:10:30,356 --> 00:10:32,425
where they can live
without human threat.

113
00:10:34,894 --> 00:10:37,697
Now, every now and then I...

114
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:41,734
I do snare kids...

115
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,771
...when they talk out of turn.

116
00:10:56,549 --> 00:10:57,917
Can you turn her over?

117
00:11:05,591 --> 00:11:07,727
The body was dumped
postmortem in the water,

118
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,462
probably a good week ago.

119
00:11:13,332 --> 00:11:15,801
What do you think this about?

120
00:11:15,835 --> 00:11:19,238
Well, I'm not sure,
but I'll make a note.

121
00:11:37,957 --> 00:11:39,592
Get forensics up here.

122
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,444
Sheriff!

123
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:09,555
You think whoever killed her
was hunting her for sport?

124
00:12:11,423 --> 00:12:13,492
I wouldn't call that a sport,
but, yeah.

125
00:12:14,627 --> 00:12:15,761
She was hunted.

126
00:12:17,763 --> 00:12:19,899
Somebody get a saw
and cut this out.

127
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,774
Jesus. You pregnant?

128
00:14:12,212 --> 00:14:14,013
Aren't you a bit old
for that?

129
00:14:14,046 --> 00:14:16,216
Still have no manners,
huh, Rayburn?

130
00:14:16,249 --> 00:14:18,951
Still got no personality,
eh, Blackhawk?

131
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:21,221
Got something to talk to you
about.

132
00:14:21,254 --> 00:14:24,657
Well, you better
come inside then.

133
00:14:25,858 --> 00:14:27,127
Not you.

134
00:14:32,731 --> 00:14:36,669
I missed you.
Oh, I missed you.

135
00:14:36,702 --> 00:14:38,204
I don't suppose
you and Blackhawk came here

136
00:14:38,238 --> 00:14:40,073
to pass out cigars.

137
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:42,942
Uh...

138
00:14:47,046 --> 00:14:50,683
Karl and me want to hold
a funeral for Gwen.

139
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:56,989
You know, five years
is a long time, Ray.

140
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:01,194
I don't want to do this
without you.

141
00:15:02,594 --> 00:15:04,230
She's my daughter too.

142
00:15:04,264 --> 00:15:06,066
I know.

143
00:15:06,099 --> 00:15:09,001
I got a say in this,
and I say no.

144
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:11,537
Ray, don't make this harder.

145
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,207
Well, you can't replace Gwen
with Blackhawk's fuckin' baby.

146
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,842
Hey!
That's not fair.

147
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,911
You think you're the only one
who misses her?

148
00:15:26,752 --> 00:15:28,821
After everything that's
happened, you're still drinking?

149
00:15:28,854 --> 00:15:29,989
Oh, shut up.

150
00:15:36,996 --> 00:15:39,132
It's just a formality.

151
00:15:39,165 --> 00:15:42,034
Just sign it and the court'll issue
an official death certificate.

152
00:15:46,206 --> 00:15:49,242
Listen, we bought a plot,
and it's a really nice place.

153
00:15:56,882 --> 00:15:58,584
Funeral's in two weeks.

154
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,799
Come in.

155
00:16:13,832 --> 00:16:16,602
Wasn't easy,
but we got it out.

156
00:16:19,105 --> 00:16:21,840
You know, there's plenty
of people happy you're sheriff.

157
00:16:21,874 --> 00:16:23,575
You can't please everybody.

158
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:27,213
Thanks, Hansen.

159
00:17:19,965 --> 00:17:22,202
<i>This just in, breaking news.</i>

160
00:17:22,235 --> 00:17:25,904
<i>We're here at a crime scene
by Buckridge and Echo Falls.</i>

161
00:17:25,938 --> 00:17:28,874
<i>Looks like there is a body
of a young woman here,</i>

162
00:17:28,907 --> 00:17:31,677
<i>and the identity
has not been revealed.</i>

163
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,745
<i>We're trying to get some
interviews with the police,</i>

164
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:36,748
<i>but it looks like they're
getting ready to move the body.</i>

165
00:17:36,782 --> 00:17:38,418
<i>We'll update you more live</i>

166
00:17:38,451 --> 00:17:40,420
<i>as information
becomes available.</i>

167
00:17:40,453 --> 00:17:42,020
<i>For now, back to you.</i>

168
00:17:53,366 --> 00:17:55,767
You didn't have
to get me anything.

169
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:57,604
Mm. It's not much.

170
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,874
Where'd you find this?

171
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:06,246
It was in the storage box
in the attic.

172
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:12,017
Dad looks so young.

173
00:18:22,362 --> 00:18:23,729
We should, um...

174
00:18:25,931 --> 00:18:29,269
we should talk about what
happened to you in the barn.

175
00:18:29,302 --> 00:18:30,969
No.

176
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:39,179
I should have adopted you
when Mom and Dad died.

177
00:18:39,212 --> 00:18:42,148
I should have taken you
to Chicago with me.

178
00:18:42,182 --> 00:18:45,017
You didn't know nothin'
about raising a kid.

179
00:18:45,051 --> 00:18:47,920
Yeah, well, I knew more
than those fucking people.

180
00:18:58,797 --> 00:18:59,998
Hey, Alice?

181
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:04,103
Yeah?

182
00:19:04,137 --> 00:19:07,739
If I messed up and did something
bad, what would you do?

183
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:09,409
What are you talking about?

184
00:19:11,344 --> 00:19:15,415
If I fucked up and did something
stupid, would you help me out?

185
00:19:21,054 --> 00:19:22,322
Sheriff?

186
00:19:24,324 --> 00:19:26,092
Hold on a sec, all right?

187
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,098
I'm Rayburn Swanson.

188
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:33,932
I know who you are.
What do you want?

189
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:36,269
I was told at the station
I could find you here.

190
00:19:36,302 --> 00:19:39,539
I need to see that girl.
She could be my daughter.

191
00:19:39,572 --> 00:19:41,274
I'm kind of in the middle
of something...

192
00:19:41,307 --> 00:19:43,176
Please.

193
00:19:45,844 --> 00:19:48,348
All right, well, we'll finish
this when I get back, okay?

194
00:20:01,494 --> 00:20:02,894
Well?

195
00:20:06,099 --> 00:20:07,567
No.

196
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,934
No.

197
00:20:14,906 --> 00:20:16,342
Fuck.

198
00:20:16,376 --> 00:20:18,211
I saw your brother earlier.

199
00:20:18,244 --> 00:20:20,280
Someone sure did
a number on him.

200
00:20:20,313 --> 00:20:22,448
Hope he didn't give you
any trouble.

201
00:20:22,482 --> 00:20:25,084
I got to be honest,
he has some bad habits.

202
00:20:25,118 --> 00:20:27,086
Some? Jesus Christ.

203
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,887
You know what gets me the most?
Those knuckles.

204
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,456
- Those knuckles fuckin' kill me.
- Yeah.

205
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,525
That and he went through
a six-pack while I examined him.

206
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:34,926
Just? It's usually a case.

207
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,429
Oh. Doctor,

208
00:20:36,462 --> 00:20:40,099
<i>do you know much about Rayburn?</i>

209
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,169
Do you have kids?

210
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:45,171
No.

211
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:47,407
Then you can't begin to imagine
what he's gone through.

212
00:21:04,557 --> 00:21:06,192
Can I join you?

213
00:21:08,461 --> 00:21:10,962
Sure.

214
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:15,335
Hey, Pete.

215
00:21:15,368 --> 00:21:16,868
Hey, Alice. Long time.

216
00:21:18,638 --> 00:21:21,441
I remember hearing about the
disappearance of your daughter.

217
00:21:23,076 --> 00:21:25,877
Things like that didn't happen
around here.

218
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:27,547
Yeah, the world's
a shitty place.

219
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,483
It can be.

220
00:21:30,516 --> 00:21:32,418
Well, it was for that girl
you found today.

221
00:21:34,654 --> 00:21:36,955
I've only been sheriff
a couple of months.

222
00:21:38,324 --> 00:21:39,958
I'm still catching up
on active cases.

223
00:21:39,991 --> 00:21:43,995
Yeah, my daughter's case
is far from active.

224
00:21:46,132 --> 00:21:48,534
My training is very different
from the officers around here.

225
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:50,269
Yeah, I heard.
What do you want?

226
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:55,174
A chance to prove...

227
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,042
The chance of solving
a missing persons case

228
00:21:57,076 --> 00:21:59,479
after 48 hours is almost zero.

229
00:21:59,512 --> 00:22:03,082
What do you think the chances
are after five goddamn years?

230
00:22:03,116 --> 00:22:05,984
Or didn't they teach you that
in your fancy college?

231
00:22:11,324 --> 00:22:12,658
I'm going to take a leak.

232
00:22:12,692 --> 00:22:14,926
You gonna be here
when I come back?

233
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,596
- You need me to be?
- Not really.

234
00:22:16,629 --> 00:22:19,565
Don't hesitate to call, Rayburn.

235
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:22,168
- I'm here to help.
- I don't got a phone.

236
00:22:55,701 --> 00:22:57,170
Quiet, Thor.

237
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:04,710
You ain't getting shit unless
I see something in those...

238
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:07,680
What the hell?

239
00:23:07,713 --> 00:23:09,348
Thor.

240
00:23:29,135 --> 00:23:31,270
Son of a bitch.

241
00:24:11,377 --> 00:24:13,813
I know you're there, pal.

242
00:24:13,846 --> 00:24:16,082
Just want to talk,
that's all.

243
00:24:23,523 --> 00:24:25,791
This is a sanctuary.

244
00:24:25,825 --> 00:24:27,393
You can't hunt here.

245
00:24:43,109 --> 00:24:45,144
Don't be getting stupid.

246
00:25:33,793 --> 00:25:35,328
Come on.

247
00:26:56,976 --> 00:26:58,477
Oh...

248
00:27:48,894 --> 00:27:50,730
Okay, asshole.

249
00:27:50,763 --> 00:27:52,431
What were you tracking?

250
00:30:48,941 --> 00:30:50,643
Whatever it is,
I'm innocent.

251
00:30:50,676 --> 00:30:52,845
Oh, there's nothing innocent
about you, Jim.

252
00:30:55,148 --> 00:30:56,916
Your parents
would be proud.

253
00:30:59,785 --> 00:31:00,920
Thanks.

254
00:31:02,554 --> 00:31:03,923
You have a minute?

255
00:31:03,956 --> 00:31:05,457
Sure.

256
00:31:06,792 --> 00:31:08,460
You hear about that girl

257
00:31:08,494 --> 00:31:09,995
they found dead
in the boundary waters?

258
00:31:10,029 --> 00:31:12,098
Yeah, you betcha.
Horrible thing.

259
00:31:12,132 --> 00:31:14,967
Was she really hunted,
like the papers said?

260
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,441
What do you think he used?

261
00:31:26,578 --> 00:31:28,981
World's oldest weapon
delivery system.

262
00:31:29,014 --> 00:31:30,582
It's called an atlatl.

263
00:31:30,616 --> 00:31:32,885
Developed over
30,000 years ago.

264
00:31:32,918 --> 00:31:34,820
And people still use these
for hunting?

265
00:31:34,853 --> 00:31:36,722
Maybe some real die-hards,
but it ain't legal.

266
00:31:38,924 --> 00:31:41,194
Clearly you're not
a suspect.

267
00:31:41,227 --> 00:31:42,828
Hold your horses.

268
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:47,733
A well-made atlatl
can deliver a spear

269
00:31:47,766 --> 00:31:49,635
over 100 miles an hour.

270
00:31:52,604 --> 00:31:55,040
- Jesus.
- Ain't no toy.

271
00:31:55,075 --> 00:31:57,077
It was designed to kill.

272
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:59,578
Do any members
use an atlatl?

273
00:31:59,611 --> 00:32:01,747
- Not that I know of.
- Where could you buy one?

274
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,217
Well, you're not going to find
it at Walmart, that's for sure.

275
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:07,153
There's a local fella
you could probably start with.

276
00:32:07,187 --> 00:32:09,155
Sam Moonblood's his name.

277
00:32:09,189 --> 00:32:11,291
Hangs at the Factory
over in Sawbill.

278
00:32:11,324 --> 00:32:14,194
Makes 'em... and he sells 'em.

279
00:32:15,627 --> 00:32:17,596
Thanks.

280
00:32:17,629 --> 00:32:21,000
Careful, Alice,
when you pay him a visit.

281
00:32:21,033 --> 00:32:22,935
He's not too friendly
to your kind.

282
00:32:22,968 --> 00:32:24,903
Women? Or cops?

283
00:32:26,005 --> 00:32:27,207
Both.

284
00:33:17,656 --> 00:33:18,991
Hey.

285
00:34:21,987 --> 00:34:23,922
Yo, bitch! What you want?

286
00:34:36,069 --> 00:34:37,736
You lost...

287
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:39,738
or looking for your brother?

288
00:34:41,274 --> 00:34:43,008
I have some questions.

289
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:45,411
That badge don't mean shit
out here, lady.

290
00:34:45,445 --> 00:34:47,280
Is Sam Moonblood around?

291
00:34:47,313 --> 00:34:49,014
He's probably huntin'.

292
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:50,250
Oh, yeah? Whereabouts?

293
00:34:50,283 --> 00:34:53,119
Shut your cock-hole, Patty.

294
00:34:54,387 --> 00:34:56,822
Does Sam Moonblood use atlatls
when he hunts?

295
00:34:56,855 --> 00:34:58,391
What are you getting at?

296
00:35:00,293 --> 00:35:02,794
We hear things out here too,
you know.

297
00:35:02,828 --> 00:35:05,265
Sam's a lot of things...

298
00:35:05,298 --> 00:35:06,832
but he ain't a killer.

299
00:35:09,034 --> 00:35:11,837
You tell Sam Moonblood
I'm looking for him.

300
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:14,174
Fucking dick.

301
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,069
Oh, shit.

302
00:35:45,238 --> 00:35:48,208
Moonblood has a place
over in Sawbill.

303
00:35:48,241 --> 00:35:49,908
You'll find him there.

304
00:35:49,942 --> 00:35:51,977
Thank you, Patty.

305
00:35:53,946 --> 00:35:55,415
Look after yourself.

306
00:37:31,444 --> 00:37:33,179
What the...

307
00:37:35,315 --> 00:37:37,283
Hey. Hey.

308
00:37:39,152 --> 00:37:40,286
Hey.

309
00:37:43,556 --> 00:37:46,125
Hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on, hold on.

310
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:48,361
Hey, hey, I'm not
gonna hurt you.

311
00:37:48,394 --> 00:37:50,430
I'm not gonna
hurt you, okay?

312
00:37:50,463 --> 00:37:52,365
Listen to me, okay?

313
00:37:52,398 --> 00:37:54,334
Let me help you.

314
00:37:54,367 --> 00:37:56,102
I want to help you.

315
00:37:56,135 --> 00:37:57,403
Okay?

316
00:37:57,437 --> 00:37:58,904
Let me show you.

317
00:37:58,937 --> 00:38:00,239
Please.

318
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:07,213
It's gonna be a lot warmer
down there out of the wind.

319
00:38:07,246 --> 00:38:09,981
We don't go down there,
we'll freeze.

320
00:38:11,317 --> 00:38:13,052
Please.

321
00:38:13,086 --> 00:38:14,986
Nothing bad's gonna happen.

322
00:38:34,674 --> 00:38:36,041
Here.

323
00:38:36,075 --> 00:38:37,410
Hold this.

324
00:38:37,443 --> 00:38:39,010
Shit.

325
00:38:41,481 --> 00:38:43,048
Goddamn it.

326
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:46,052
Oh, come on.

327
00:38:46,085 --> 00:38:47,919
No, no, no, no, no.

328
00:38:47,953 --> 00:38:49,955
Oh, no, you got
to be kid...

329
00:38:49,988 --> 00:38:53,092
Oh, no. Shit!

330
00:38:53,126 --> 00:38:55,428
My whiskey.

331
00:39:05,036 --> 00:39:07,440
My ex-wife used to call me
abrasive.

332
00:39:09,375 --> 00:39:11,677
I think I understand
what she meant now.

333
00:39:13,479 --> 00:39:15,081
I'm sorry.

334
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,685
This is a pitfall.

335
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:21,287
For trapping animals.

336
00:39:26,692 --> 00:39:28,960
This is a real
nasty way to go.

337
00:39:28,994 --> 00:39:31,397
There's a few of these
old traps around,

338
00:39:31,431 --> 00:39:33,266
but I don't use 'em anymore.

339
00:39:45,144 --> 00:39:46,412
Okay...

340
00:39:48,314 --> 00:39:50,616
I'm just going
to put these on you, okay?

341
00:39:57,723 --> 00:40:00,092
Okay, there you go.

342
00:40:01,794 --> 00:40:04,363
Can you talk?

343
00:40:06,165 --> 00:40:07,433
No.

344
00:40:07,467 --> 00:40:09,068
My name's Rayburn.

345
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:18,244
M...

346
00:40:18,277 --> 00:40:19,412
O...

347
00:40:21,481 --> 00:40:24,217
Molly. Molly.

348
00:40:25,685 --> 00:40:27,753
It's nice to know you, Molly.

349
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:32,692
Do you know
who that man is?

350
00:40:34,227 --> 00:40:35,595
No?

351
00:40:42,235 --> 00:40:44,237
Try and get
some sleep, okay?

352
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,205
We got a long walk
tomorrow.

353
00:40:58,751 --> 00:41:00,653
It's going to be okay.

354
00:41:23,409 --> 00:41:25,278
Sam Moonblood?

355
00:43:21,694 --> 00:43:23,696
- Freeze!
- Whoa, easy!

356
00:43:23,729 --> 00:43:25,665
It's me, Alice.

357
00:43:25,698 --> 00:43:27,600
Holy shit.

358
00:43:31,671 --> 00:43:33,739
Followed you
and called you in.

359
00:43:33,773 --> 00:43:35,941
Jesus Christ.
Breaking and entering?

360
00:43:35,975 --> 00:43:37,443
It was an urgent matter.

361
00:43:37,476 --> 00:43:38,844
Yeah, well, you need
a warrant, Sheriff.

362
00:43:38,878 --> 00:43:40,513
Probable cause.

363
00:43:40,546 --> 00:43:41,914
Moonblood's tracks
are all over this.

364
00:43:41,947 --> 00:43:43,749
We know that the suspect
used an atlatl,

365
00:43:43,783 --> 00:43:45,685
and he has atlatls
in his fucking basement,

366
00:43:45,718 --> 00:43:48,320
and the spearhead
has an MB on it.

367
00:43:48,354 --> 00:43:50,756
And no one knows
where the hell he is.

368
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:53,292
Does your brother
own an atlatl?

369
00:43:57,363 --> 00:43:58,764
Young girl missing.

370
00:43:58,798 --> 00:44:00,966
Now, the mother hangs out
at the Factory.

371
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,470
Said she got in an altercation
a few nights back with a man

372
00:44:04,503 --> 00:44:06,238
she named Brooks.

373
00:44:07,473 --> 00:44:10,309
- What are you trying to say?
- He was getting handsy with her.

374
00:44:10,342 --> 00:44:12,445
He wouldn't leave,
so Sam Moonblood tossed him out.

375
00:44:12,478 --> 00:44:14,380
My brother would never
kidnap a young girl.

376
00:44:16,615 --> 00:44:19,318
We never know as much
as we think we do, Alice.

377
00:44:19,351 --> 00:44:20,953
Now, I know your brother
went through some hard times

378
00:44:20,986 --> 00:44:22,722
after your parents passed...

379
00:44:22,755 --> 00:44:25,257
There's nothing wrong
with my brother.

380
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:27,827
- Then bring him in.
- Are you forgetting who the sheriff is?

381
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:30,529
There is no sheriff here.

382
00:44:30,563 --> 00:44:32,898
This is Sawbill nation.

383
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:43,409
We make quite a pair, kid.

384
00:44:47,713 --> 00:44:49,982
My place is southwest of here,

385
00:44:50,015 --> 00:44:53,018
probably six miles.

386
00:45:22,414 --> 00:45:24,550
Hey. Hey, it's me.

387
00:45:25,818 --> 00:45:26,952
Brooks?

388
00:46:09,129 --> 00:46:10,663
I need a break.

389
00:46:25,778 --> 00:46:27,046
It's not much further.

390
00:46:31,817 --> 00:46:33,552
I need a drink.

391
00:46:42,995 --> 00:46:45,898
I bet your mom and dad
will be real happy to see you.

392
00:46:52,138 --> 00:46:55,407
I lost my daughter too.

393
00:46:57,009 --> 00:46:58,577
On my watch.

394
00:47:01,147 --> 00:47:04,150
You know what?
You might...

395
00:47:04,184 --> 00:47:05,851
maybe...

396
00:47:05,885 --> 00:47:07,453
yeah.

397
00:47:10,723 --> 00:47:11,824
Open it.

398
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:26,405
You recognize her?

399
00:47:41,054 --> 00:47:42,155
Let's go.

400
00:47:49,795 --> 00:47:51,630
<i>Sheriff, copy a call.</i>

401
00:47:51,664 --> 00:47:53,565
<i>My brothers are complaining</i>

402
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,467
<i>Rayburn Swanson confiscated
their rifles.</i>

403
00:47:55,501 --> 00:47:57,036
<i>Can you go check it out?</i>

404
00:48:24,164 --> 00:48:25,564
Take a seat.

405
00:48:40,313 --> 00:48:42,182
Let me get you some water.

406
00:48:50,123 --> 00:48:52,058
Thor?

407
00:49:42,375 --> 00:49:43,909
Who are you?

408
00:49:43,942 --> 00:49:45,544
Who are you?

409
00:51:11,864 --> 00:51:14,167
Rayburn?

410
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,902
Rayburn,
it's Sheriff Gustafson.

411
00:51:16,935 --> 00:51:20,073
I'm here about
those guns you took.

412
00:51:20,106 --> 00:51:22,040
Do you have a moment to talk?

413
00:51:42,861 --> 00:51:44,130
Put your gun down!

414
00:51:44,164 --> 00:51:46,199
I said put your gun down!

415
00:51:46,232 --> 00:51:48,901
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- Put your gun down, goddamn it!

416
00:51:48,934 --> 00:51:50,869
- He's still here. He's here!
- What have you done?

417
00:51:50,903 --> 00:51:52,804
- What have you done?
- What? No, no, no, no, no!

418
00:51:52,838 --> 00:51:55,974
- What have you done?
- Sheriff! Behind you, behind you!

419
00:51:56,008 --> 00:51:57,809
Drop your weapon!

420
00:51:57,843 --> 00:51:59,445
Drop your weapon
and get on your knees!

421
00:51:59,479 --> 00:52:01,214
Now!

422
00:52:01,247 --> 00:52:02,714
Do it now!

423
00:52:06,486 --> 00:52:09,721
- Oh, my God.
- Put your hands on your head, now!

424
00:52:12,858 --> 00:52:14,060
Sheriff.

425
00:52:15,794 --> 00:52:18,064
This man,
he hunted this girl.

426
00:52:24,836 --> 00:52:26,306
You got to be careful.

427
00:52:28,807 --> 00:52:30,143
Sheriff.

428
00:52:32,811 --> 00:52:34,746
Sheriff.

429
00:52:36,316 --> 00:52:38,117
Oh! Oh!

430
00:52:42,155 --> 00:52:43,989
Go, Brooks.

431
00:52:44,022 --> 00:52:45,225
Go home.

432
00:52:56,369 --> 00:52:57,803
Rayburn?

433
00:54:03,035 --> 00:54:04,537
Help!

434
00:54:07,073 --> 00:54:10,008
Hello? Hello?

435
00:54:10,042 --> 00:54:12,844
<i>This is dispatch.
Identify, please.</i>

436
00:54:12,878 --> 00:54:17,049
I need an ambulance at
Rayburn Swanson's immediately.

437
00:54:19,185 --> 00:54:21,454
A girl is hurt real bad.

438
00:54:21,487 --> 00:54:22,921
Rayburn Swanson's.

439
00:54:35,368 --> 00:54:36,602
Karl.

440
00:54:42,141 --> 00:54:44,042
Ray?

441
00:54:44,077 --> 00:54:45,278
What happened?

442
00:54:45,311 --> 00:54:47,146
It's Gustafson.

443
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:48,348
She fucking shot me.

444
00:54:48,381 --> 00:54:50,616
What? Why?

445
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:53,152
She's protecting Brooks.

446
00:54:53,186 --> 00:54:54,354
He did it.

447
00:54:55,555 --> 00:54:57,390
We need to get you
to a hospital.

448
00:54:57,423 --> 00:55:01,194
No, no, no.
They'll be looking for me.

449
00:55:01,227 --> 00:55:04,630
I need checkpoints on every road
in and out of this county.

450
00:55:04,664 --> 00:55:06,965
- You hear me?
- Yes. She's coming with you.

451
00:55:23,249 --> 00:55:25,618
What the fuck have I done?

452
00:55:28,688 --> 00:55:30,356
<i>All units, all units.</i>

453
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:33,126
<i>Be on the lookout
for Rayburn Swanson.</i>

454
00:55:35,428 --> 00:55:36,629
It's okay, just hold on.

455
00:55:36,662 --> 00:55:38,398
No.

456
00:55:38,431 --> 00:55:40,233
Hold on,
we're going to be there soon.

457
00:55:40,266 --> 00:55:41,667
Hang in there, buddy.

458
00:55:43,302 --> 00:55:44,670
I'm sorry.

459
00:55:47,173 --> 00:55:48,341
What?

460
00:55:48,374 --> 00:55:50,309
You're not too old...

461
00:55:51,477 --> 00:55:53,044
to be a mother again.

462
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:54,180
You deserve it.

463
00:55:55,681 --> 00:55:57,183
I'm sorry I wasn't
a better father.

464
00:55:57,216 --> 00:55:59,218
Just stop. It's okay.

465
00:56:01,554 --> 00:56:03,189
And, Karl,
you're a good man.

466
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:07,460
You're just saying that because
you think you're dying.

467
00:56:07,493 --> 00:56:09,328
Don't worry, we can go back
to hating each other

468
00:56:09,362 --> 00:56:11,364
after you're all stitched up.

469
00:56:23,342 --> 00:56:25,077
Thanks for coming, Doctor.
I appreciate it.

470
00:56:25,111 --> 00:56:27,513
- Where is he?
- He's over here.

471
00:56:27,547 --> 00:56:29,148
Jesus.

472
00:56:31,049 --> 00:56:33,519
It's the best I could do, doc.

473
00:56:36,489 --> 00:56:38,057
Okay, this is it.

474
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:40,226
He's here.
This is Dr. Boone.

475
00:56:40,259 --> 00:56:42,195
We met at the morgue.

476
00:56:42,228 --> 00:56:44,297
I hope you don't plan
on taking me there, Doc.

477
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:46,132
What in the hell
did you get yourself into?

478
00:56:46,165 --> 00:56:48,434
I came across
the wrong kind of man.

479
00:56:48,468 --> 00:56:50,203
Or woman, I guess.

480
00:56:50,236 --> 00:56:52,003
He needs a hospital,
not a fucking RV.

481
00:56:52,037 --> 00:56:54,005
I have emergency supplies,
including blood bags.

482
00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:55,141
Please?

483
00:56:56,742 --> 00:56:58,511
We have no choice, Doc.

484
00:56:58,544 --> 00:57:00,112
I'll see what I can do.

485
00:57:00,146 --> 00:57:01,581
I need some space.

486
00:57:01,614 --> 00:57:03,216
Okay. Yeah.

487
00:57:03,249 --> 00:57:04,517
Okay.

488
00:57:19,765 --> 00:57:21,267
He'll be okay,
all right?

489
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:22,535
Okay.

490
00:57:25,605 --> 00:57:27,173
Do me a favor,

491
00:57:27,206 --> 00:57:29,609
go back to the car
and lock the doors, okay?

492
00:57:29,642 --> 00:57:31,143
Be careful.

493
00:57:36,749 --> 00:57:38,251
Yeah, this is Blackhawk.

494
00:57:38,284 --> 00:57:40,219
I need backup
at the Factory right now.

495
00:57:50,096 --> 00:57:51,364
Hey.

496
00:57:53,099 --> 00:57:54,300
Can I get some?

497
00:57:57,203 --> 00:57:58,604
Brooks!

498
00:57:58,638 --> 00:58:00,540
Hey, come here!

499
00:58:02,174 --> 00:58:03,709
Brooks! Hey!

500
00:58:20,393 --> 00:58:21,494
Brooks!

501
00:58:22,595 --> 00:58:23,796
Brooks! Stop!

502
00:58:31,771 --> 00:58:33,439
Get back
or I'll fucking kill him.

503
00:58:33,472 --> 00:58:35,741
- Okay. Stay calm.
- Move the cars or I'll kill him.

504
00:58:35,775 --> 00:58:39,211
Hey, take it easy, Brooks.
Let's just think this thing through here.

505
00:58:39,245 --> 00:58:40,713
This isn't just my fault, okay?

506
00:58:40,746 --> 00:58:42,148
I didn't start any of it!

507
00:58:42,181 --> 00:58:43,616
Hey, I understand.

508
00:58:43,649 --> 00:58:45,685
But you have the power
to put an end to this.

509
00:58:45,718 --> 00:58:48,654
So why don't you just put that
down and we'll talk, okay?

510
00:58:48,688 --> 00:58:51,324
Brooks, we're just trying to help
Rayburn here. He's seriously hurt.

511
00:58:51,357 --> 00:58:53,125
You can help him
when we're on the road, okay?

512
00:58:53,159 --> 00:58:54,393
Just move the cars...

513
00:58:54,427 --> 00:58:57,563
Come here.

514
00:58:57,597 --> 00:58:59,432
Put your hands
behind your back.

515
00:58:59,465 --> 00:59:01,601
Hey, hey, hey. Easy. Easy.

516
00:59:09,875 --> 00:59:12,178
Did they find Rayburn?

517
00:59:12,211 --> 00:59:13,646
Your brother's
been arrested.

518
00:59:27,426 --> 00:59:28,728
Hey.

519
00:59:28,761 --> 00:59:30,563
- Where is he?
- Take it easy.

520
00:59:30,596 --> 00:59:31,864
I want to talk to him.

521
00:59:31,897 --> 00:59:33,566
Where is he?

522
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:36,302
Did you shoot
Rayburn Swanson?

523
00:59:37,737 --> 00:59:40,706
That is an ongoing investigation
in my county.

524
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:42,908
It has nothing
to do with you.

525
00:59:42,942 --> 00:59:45,911
I want to talk to my fucking
brother, goddamn it.

526
00:59:45,945 --> 00:59:49,582
No. This is not
your county, Alice.

527
00:59:49,615 --> 00:59:51,917
Now, your brother
wants to come clean.

528
00:59:51,951 --> 00:59:53,786
Says he has something
to show us.

529
01:00:15,808 --> 01:00:17,476
Over there.

530
01:00:35,361 --> 01:00:36,829
Shit.

531
01:00:38,531 --> 01:00:40,266
Call a paramedic.

532
01:00:52,712 --> 01:00:55,448
- <i>Who is he?</i>
- <i>Sam Moonblood.</i>

533
01:00:55,481 --> 01:00:57,016
After the altercation
at the Factory,

534
01:00:57,049 --> 01:00:59,285
your brother jumped him
in the parking lot.

535
01:00:59,318 --> 01:01:01,620
Been keeping him here
ever since.

536
01:01:01,654 --> 01:01:04,690
Brooks says he doesn't know
anything about Molly Johnson.

537
01:01:04,724 --> 01:01:06,358
I believe him.

538
01:01:06,392 --> 01:01:09,328
Several eyewitnesses place him
at the Factory

539
01:01:09,361 --> 01:01:12,598
around the same time you
and Rayburn had your encounter.

540
01:01:12,631 --> 01:01:16,736
So whoever was out there
with you, it ain't Brooks.

541
01:01:18,437 --> 01:01:19,972
I'm going to recommend
you be placed on leave

542
01:01:20,005 --> 01:01:21,941
while you're investigated.

543
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:26,512
We got pics of this already.

544
01:01:38,557 --> 01:01:40,860
I'm sorry, Alice.

545
01:01:42,428 --> 01:01:43,562
I got angry.

546
01:01:44,997 --> 01:01:47,333
But I had nothing
to do with those girls.

547
01:01:51,871 --> 01:01:53,939
Hey.

548
01:01:53,973 --> 01:01:56,442
You know I came back for you?

549
01:01:58,410 --> 01:01:59,678
You know that, right?

550
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:10,456
Better go, Alice.

551
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:36,382
Rayburn didn't kill
those girls.

552
01:02:40,553 --> 01:02:43,022
Well,
thanks for saving my life.

553
01:02:43,056 --> 01:02:45,457
I think
you saved mine too.

554
01:02:50,763 --> 01:02:52,464
They got him, right?

555
01:02:55,968 --> 01:02:57,436
What?

556
01:02:57,469 --> 01:02:59,038
Karl says it wasn't Brooks.

557
01:03:01,006 --> 01:03:03,076
He says the timelines
don't match.

558
01:05:01,061 --> 01:05:03,929
<i>Sheriff,
we got a call from Sawbill Reservation.</i>

559
01:05:03,963 --> 01:05:06,632
<i>Blackhawk wants to see you
at the Factory ASAP.</i>

560
01:05:06,665 --> 01:05:07,933
<i>Over and out.</i>

561
01:05:38,764 --> 01:05:41,201
Funny, Rayburn changed
his story.

562
01:05:41,234 --> 01:05:43,869
Said that it was the suspect
that must have shot him.

563
01:05:45,971 --> 01:05:47,906
We all make mistakes.

564
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:49,242
Yeah.

565
01:05:50,609 --> 01:05:52,212
Let me do the talking, okay?

566
01:05:53,579 --> 01:05:55,215
<i>We got one lead.</i>

567
01:05:55,248 --> 01:05:58,751
Whoever this guy is likely
bought an atlatl from you.

568
01:05:58,784 --> 01:06:02,921
I'm not the only one in America
who makes atlatls.

569
01:06:02,955 --> 01:06:05,958
Who you been selling to
in the past year or so?

570
01:06:05,991 --> 01:06:07,893
Can't be too many.

571
01:06:07,926 --> 01:06:10,130
Look...

572
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:15,268
I'm really sorry about what
my brother did to you, okay?

573
01:06:15,301 --> 01:06:17,770
He's going to get
what's coming to him.

574
01:06:17,803 --> 01:06:20,939
But right now, there's someone
out there killing teenage girls,

575
01:06:20,973 --> 01:06:22,308
and we need you to talk to us.

576
01:06:27,046 --> 01:06:28,314
I don't got names.

577
01:06:28,348 --> 01:06:30,049
Only faces.

578
01:06:30,083 --> 01:06:31,617
I don't keep receipts,

579
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:33,786
'cause nobody
returns my atlatls.

580
01:06:33,819 --> 01:06:35,621
Now, if you got mug shots,
maybe I can help you,

581
01:06:35,654 --> 01:06:37,790
but if not,
you're shit out of luck.

582
01:06:48,901 --> 01:06:50,702
That's a good spear.

583
01:06:50,736 --> 01:06:52,072
It's made from pine.

584
01:06:52,105 --> 01:06:53,806
I only use birch.

585
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:55,808
I don't mark my spears.

586
01:06:55,841 --> 01:06:58,010
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

587
01:07:02,415 --> 01:07:04,750
Thanks for your time.

588
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:08,881
Can't go one day, Dad?

589
01:08:08,914 --> 01:08:11,049
I'm just going
to get a beer.

590
01:08:11,084 --> 01:08:13,186
Jesus, you're like
your mom.

591
01:08:13,219 --> 01:08:14,720
Should I be like you?

592
01:08:15,854 --> 01:08:17,390
I'll be right back, okay?

593
01:08:18,458 --> 01:08:20,260
I'm going to start walking.

594
01:08:21,793 --> 01:08:23,463
Don't be stupid.

595
01:08:47,953 --> 01:08:50,022
Whiskey.

596
01:09:47,247 --> 01:09:48,981
She's gonna be okay?

597
01:09:49,014 --> 01:09:50,116
We're just
gonna keep an eye on her.

598
01:09:50,149 --> 01:09:52,017
Thank you.

599
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:21,813
Hi, Molly.

600
01:10:24,117 --> 01:10:26,486
We're going to get you
all better, I promise.

601
01:11:22,141 --> 01:11:24,544
No, I'm just here
to settle my debt.

602
01:12:34,647 --> 01:12:36,115
Hey!

603
01:12:36,149 --> 01:12:37,650
Can I help you?

604
01:12:37,683 --> 01:12:39,485
No.

605
01:12:39,519 --> 01:12:40,653
Nice truck.

606
01:12:50,530 --> 01:12:52,931
I need to see
the autopsy report.

607
01:14:45,411 --> 01:14:47,146
Sorry to bother you.

608
01:14:47,179 --> 01:14:48,614
Yeah?

609
01:14:50,583 --> 01:14:52,351
Is your son home?

610
01:14:52,385 --> 01:14:54,554
No one here but me.

611
01:14:56,222 --> 01:14:57,490
Well, it's just...

612
01:14:58,891 --> 01:15:01,561
last week this guy helped
jump-start my truck.

613
01:15:01,594 --> 01:15:03,663
I could've sworn this was
the truck he was driving.

614
01:15:03,696 --> 01:15:05,331
Just wanted to thank him.

615
01:15:05,364 --> 01:15:06,732
- Sorry about that.
- Oh.

616
01:15:06,766 --> 01:15:08,200
That would've been
my neighbor.

617
01:15:08,234 --> 01:15:09,769
He uses it sometimes.

618
01:15:10,803 --> 01:15:12,271
Lives up the hill there.

619
01:15:15,474 --> 01:15:17,176
Well, thank you, sir.

620
01:15:17,209 --> 01:15:18,411
You betcha.

621
01:17:49,528 --> 01:17:52,631
Dr. Boone left for the day,
but if you'd like to follow me,

622
01:17:52,665 --> 01:17:55,334
the autopsy report
should be in his office.

623
01:17:55,367 --> 01:17:56,869
Great.

624
01:17:56,902 --> 01:17:58,838
This can't be the file.

625
01:17:58,871 --> 01:18:00,940
It has none
of the photo evidence in it.

626
01:18:00,973 --> 01:18:02,641
Oh, I'll keep looking.

627
01:18:02,675 --> 01:18:04,009
Yeah, there have to be more.

628
01:18:10,883 --> 01:18:12,485
Who's this?

629
01:18:13,986 --> 01:18:16,422
Dr. Boone's daughter,
Melissa.

630
01:18:16,455 --> 01:18:17,757
Melissa.

631
01:18:17,790 --> 01:18:19,358
I didn't know
he had a daughter.

632
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:21,594
Yeah, she was hit
by a drunk driver

633
01:18:21,627 --> 01:18:23,063
and left alone
in the forest to die.

634
01:18:23,096 --> 01:18:24,764
Poor girl.

635
01:18:24,797 --> 01:18:26,665
Melissa.

636
01:18:26,699 --> 01:18:28,868
Melissa Boone.

637
01:18:34,807 --> 01:18:36,408
Open it.

638
01:18:41,847 --> 01:18:43,048
Go upstairs.

639
01:18:44,650 --> 01:18:46,886
Hansen, with me.

640
01:18:53,726 --> 01:18:54,994
Call the paramedics.

641
01:18:55,027 --> 01:18:56,495
Jesus Christ.

642
01:19:37,070 --> 01:19:39,872
We got the APB out on Boone.

643
01:19:39,905 --> 01:19:41,540
You okay?

644
01:19:43,676 --> 01:19:45,477
I have to talk to Rayburn.

645
01:20:11,437 --> 01:20:12,671
Go.

646
01:20:30,090 --> 01:20:32,558
Rayburn?

647
01:20:33,959 --> 01:20:35,461
Rayburn.

648
01:20:38,597 --> 01:20:40,032
I know who took Gwen.

649
01:22:32,278 --> 01:22:33,612
Rayburn.

650
01:22:35,881 --> 01:22:37,150
Rayburn.

651
01:23:55,661 --> 01:23:56,795
Why?

652
01:23:58,164 --> 01:23:59,965
Why Gwen?

653
01:23:59,998 --> 01:24:02,034
I was a good father.

654
01:24:02,068 --> 01:24:04,937
You were a drunk.

655
01:24:04,970 --> 01:24:07,039
She would've grown
into a fuckup,

656
01:24:07,073 --> 01:24:08,674
just like you.

657
01:24:09,975 --> 01:24:11,710
A drain on everyone.

658
01:24:13,979 --> 01:24:16,949
I only took the ones
that no one would miss.

659
01:24:41,107 --> 01:24:43,243
Rayburn, stop! Don't do it.

660
01:24:43,276 --> 01:24:44,810
Please.

661
01:24:49,082 --> 01:24:51,817
This man needs to die
for what he did to my daughter.

662
01:24:51,850 --> 01:24:53,353
Rayburn, don't do this.

663
01:24:53,386 --> 01:24:54,953
Don't do this.

664
01:24:54,987 --> 01:24:56,889
Let me take him in.

665
01:24:56,922 --> 01:24:59,092
Let him rot in jail.

666
01:25:01,894 --> 01:25:04,830
You want to talk to me
about right and wrong, Sheriff?

667
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,869
Now you can either walk away,
or you can shoot me again,

668
01:25:10,903 --> 01:25:13,739
but this ends now.

669
01:25:13,772 --> 01:25:15,175
Get up, get up.

670
01:25:15,208 --> 01:25:17,210
Goddamn it, Rayburn!

671
01:25:19,912 --> 01:25:22,215
I covered this trap years ago.

672
01:25:22,248 --> 01:25:24,484
Realized I didn't like
killing animals.

673
01:25:24,517 --> 01:25:26,286
Rayburn, please.

674
01:25:26,319 --> 01:25:28,221
I'll make an exception for you.

675
01:26:03,556 --> 01:26:07,260
You're going to let me die
like some animal?

676
01:26:10,028 --> 01:26:12,030
No.

677
01:26:12,065 --> 01:26:14,367
I would never leave
an animal suffering.

678
01:26:38,291 --> 01:26:40,193
Now we're even, Sheriff.

679
01:28:27,533 --> 01:28:29,068
<i>In local news,</i>

680
01:28:29,102 --> 01:28:30,636
<i>authorities are still searching</i>

681
01:28:30,670 --> 01:28:33,373
<i>for suspected serial killer
Dr. John Boone,</i>

682
01:28:33,406 --> 01:28:35,108
<i>whose last known whereabouts...</i>

683
01:28:35,141 --> 01:28:36,576
Don't worry, we'll get
this piece of shit.
