1
00:00:00,144 --> 00:00:02,460
Previously on "Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...

2
00:00:02,462 --> 00:00:04,396
I designed a biological implant

3
00:00:04,398 --> 00:00:05,635
to suppress my memories.

4
00:00:05,637 --> 00:00:07,330
Fitz is completely exposed.

5
00:00:07,332 --> 00:00:08,643
They will kill him if they find him,

6
00:00:08,645 --> 00:00:10,264
so no one can know his location.

7
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:12,869
Do you not know how
to fix the time machine?

8
00:00:12,871 --> 00:00:15,972
The jumps and the time we
spend in any given time period

9
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,707
are getting exponentially shorter.

10
00:00:17,709 --> 00:00:19,142
If they keep getting smaller...

11
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,178
We sink.

12
00:00:24,388 --> 00:00:26,049
We stopped jumping.

13
00:00:30,055 --> 00:00:31,287
Think of it like a nap.

14
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:32,824
Sure it is.

15
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,359
Wait. What's happening?

16
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:37,927
It didn't work.

17
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:48,411

18
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:09,926
Hey.

19
00:01:09,928 --> 00:01:11,462
What are you doing up?

20
00:01:13,065 --> 00:01:14,564
How long have you been here?

21
00:01:14,566 --> 00:01:16,766
Well, I guess, uh...

22
00:01:16,768 --> 00:01:18,268
when did you go to sleep?

23
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,769
Since then.

24
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:21,505
Did we jump again?

25
00:01:23,241 --> 00:01:25,308
I'm not sure.

26
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,710
Hey, w-where you going?

27
00:01:30,482 --> 00:01:32,182
I've got damage to nearly all systems.

28
00:01:32,184 --> 00:01:33,683
Trying to get a read on our location.

29
00:01:33,685 --> 00:01:35,718
- What's happening?
- Time Drive overloaded.

30
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,188
Any chance that's 21st-century
slang for "worked normally"?

31
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,289
Where are we?

32
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:40,344
Guys?

33
00:01:40,346 --> 00:01:43,081
Anyone want to fill me in on...

34
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:44,994
that?

35
00:01:55,707 --> 00:01:57,273
I was so much happier asleep.

36
00:01:57,275 --> 00:01:58,374
Where's Coulson?

37
00:01:58,376 --> 00:01:59,710
Charging.

38
00:01:59,712 --> 00:02:01,911
Looks like something just fried
the Quinjet's flight system.

39
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,224
We can't afford to lose that.

40
00:02:03,226 --> 00:02:04,292
You anywhere nearby?

41
00:02:04,294 --> 00:02:06,295
Hey, it's me. Everywhere's nearby.

42
00:02:06,297 --> 00:02:07,298
I'm already here.

43
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,318
I'll check it out.

44
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:12,122
Simmons? Are you seeing this?

45
00:02:12,124 --> 00:02:13,990
Yes, radiation levels
are off the charts.

46
00:02:13,992 --> 00:02:15,123
We need to get out of this.

47
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,359
I don't want to alarm anyone...

48
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:18,228
Yeah, wouldn't want to
spoil our feeling of Zen.

49
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,929
... but we're trapped in a time storm.

50
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,198
Are you just taking unrelated
words and putting them together?

51
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,333
No, Bugsy, this is real.

52
00:02:23,335 --> 00:02:24,834
It's just like Simmons said.

53
00:02:24,836 --> 00:02:25,935
We jumped within a jump,

54
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,303
and it tore a hole in space-time,

55
00:02:27,305 --> 00:02:29,539
and now we're being
pulled in towards the vortex

56
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:30,940
like we're circling a drain.

57
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,308
And if we go down that drain?

58
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,010
We'll cease to exist.

59
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:35,979
No, we'll cease to have ever existed

60
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:38,114
or be reduced to the size of an atom.

61
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:41,151
Honestly, I have no idea
how the science works here.

62
00:02:41,153 --> 00:02:42,285
So it's pulling us in.

63
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,053
Yes. We're 94 kilometers away.

64
00:02:44,055 --> 00:02:45,155
Aah!

65
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,190
Mack!

66
00:02:47,192 --> 00:02:49,392
I can't see! I can't see!

67
00:02:49,394 --> 00:02:51,327
Hey, any idea what just hit us?

68
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:52,729
Radiation.

69
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:54,397
It shorted out the doors to the Quinjet.

70
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:55,498
I'm trapped inside.

71
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:58,258
Mack? Are you okay?

72
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,295
I'm fine. Just deal with the Quinjet.

73
00:03:00,297 --> 00:03:01,336
I'll help her.

74
00:03:01,338 --> 00:03:02,906
I'll get Mack to Simmons. Can you...

75
00:03:02,908 --> 00:03:04,040
Find a way out of here?

76
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:05,209
Yeah.

77
00:03:05,211 --> 00:03:07,043
Let's hope so.

78
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,982
Simmons!

79
00:03:10,984 --> 00:03:12,215
What happened?

80
00:03:12,217 --> 00:03:14,017
I'm sure it looks worse than it is.

81
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:15,051
You're literally blind.

82
00:03:15,053 --> 00:03:16,219
It's a radiation flare.

83
00:03:16,221 --> 00:03:18,188
I have something for the burns.

84
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,392
- What?
- What?

85
00:03:22,394 --> 00:03:26,229
Just some... tools
Deke left lying around.

86
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:27,530
He's been doing a lot

87
00:03:27,532 --> 00:03:29,265
since he got back from his time away.

88
00:03:29,267 --> 00:03:30,700
Agent Simmons,

89
00:03:30,702 --> 00:03:32,602
would you like some help
examining the Time Drive?

90
00:03:32,604 --> 00:03:34,037
I would, yes. But Mack first.

91
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,738
No, fixing the Time Drive is the most...

92
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,073
Shut it. We can do both.

93
00:03:37,075 --> 00:03:38,408
Just got hit with another flare.

94
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,100
I'm showing a fire,
starboard side hallway.

95
00:03:40,102 --> 00:03:41,168
I got it.

96
00:03:48,587 --> 00:03:50,420
Fire's out!

97
00:03:50,422 --> 00:03:52,355
Great, but it won't be the last.

98
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,357
How are we supposed to prevent...

99
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,699
Is that supposed to...

100
00:04:17,415 --> 00:04:18,548
Hey.

101
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,851
What are you doing up?

102
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,287
Wait. How...

103
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:25,623
How long have you...

104
00:04:26,957 --> 00:04:28,358
Well, when did you go to sleep?

105
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,559
Since then.

106
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:32,528
Making sure you keep...

107
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,098
resting.

108
00:04:36,768 --> 00:04:38,468
I've got damage to nearly all systems.

109
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,136
Trying to get a read on our location.

110
00:04:40,138 --> 00:04:41,237
What's happening?

111
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,405
Time Drive overloaded.

112
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,206
Any chance that's 21st-century
slang for "worked normally"?

113
00:04:46,711 --> 00:04:49,345
Where are we?

114
00:04:49,347 --> 00:04:51,114
No way.

115
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,027
I was so much happier asleep.

116
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:06,195
Looks like something just fried
the Quinjet's flight system.

117
00:05:06,197 --> 00:05:07,430
We can't afford to lose that.

118
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,098
- Oh, no.
- You anywhere nearby?

119
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,100
Hey, it's me. Everywhere's nearby.

120
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,935
I'm already here. I'll check it out.

121
00:05:14,172 --> 00:05:15,338
Simmons?

122
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,841
There is a major brain fart happening.

123
00:05:16,843 --> 00:05:18,274
- Are you seeing this?
- Yes...

124
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,809
You guys, something is happening to me.

125
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:20,910
We need to get out of this.

126
00:05:20,912 --> 00:05:22,511
I don't want to alarm anyone, but...

127
00:05:22,513 --> 00:05:23,746
We're trapped in a time storm.

128
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,549
Yeah, you took the words
right out of my mouth.

129
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:30,486
Being pulled into a vortex,
circling the drain.

130
00:05:30,488 --> 00:05:33,455
W... Yeah, we're 91 kilometers away.

131
00:05:33,457 --> 00:05:34,490
- How did you...
- Crap.

132
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,078
Hey, any idea what just hit us?

133
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,481
She's trapped on the Quinjet.

134
00:05:43,483 --> 00:05:44,883
That flare just shorted the doors.

135
00:05:45,668 --> 00:05:46,669
She's right.

136
00:05:46,671 --> 00:05:49,472
I'll help her get out.

137
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,040
What's going on with you?

138
00:05:51,042 --> 00:05:52,375
I don't know.

139
00:05:52,377 --> 00:05:54,210
But I do know that Simmons is working on

140
00:05:54,212 --> 00:05:56,512
the Time Drive schematics right now,

141
00:05:56,514 --> 00:05:58,115
and that's obviously connected.

142
00:05:58,117 --> 00:06:00,350
Alright, good. Go talk to her.
We'll do what we can from here.

143
00:06:00,352 --> 00:06:02,051
Okay.

144
00:06:06,224 --> 00:06:08,191
Simmons?

145
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:09,559
You guys okay?

146
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,231
I think I'm time-looping.

147
00:06:15,233 --> 00:06:16,399
I-I've done this already.

148
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:17,667
I've done this already.

149
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,469
Oh, well, that's fun.

150
00:06:19,471 --> 00:06:21,071
It's actually creepy.

151
00:06:21,904 --> 00:06:23,706
I'll check you.

152
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,509
Is that Deke's gross '80s cologne?

153
00:06:27,645 --> 00:06:28,678
Cue Enoch.

154
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,879
Agent Simmons,

155
00:06:29,881 --> 00:06:32,249
would you like some help
examining the Time Drive?

156
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,715
Definitely. If you...

157
00:06:34,717 --> 00:06:35,950
The flares keep coming.

158
00:06:35,952 --> 00:06:37,520
There's a fire on the starboard side.

159
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,642
I got it.

160
00:06:40,726 --> 00:06:42,658
Okay...

161
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,693
See?

162
00:06:46,431 --> 00:06:47,730
Mack, the fire's out again,

163
00:06:47,732 --> 00:06:50,433
but I think I need my
head checked, 'cause...

164
00:07:12,957 --> 00:07:14,757
I've got damage to nearly all systems.

165
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:15,790
Trying to get a read on...

166
00:07:15,792 --> 00:07:17,059
Shut the cockpit door.

167
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:19,130
Watch the control panel.

168
00:07:19,132 --> 00:07:21,197
... our location.

169
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,272
Hey.

170
00:07:29,274 --> 00:07:31,607
Listen, okay, I need your help.

171
00:07:31,609 --> 00:07:33,174
You won't believe this, but I keep...

172
00:07:33,176 --> 00:07:35,044
Repeating the same events
over and over again?

173
00:07:35,046 --> 00:07:36,679
Yeah.

174
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:38,721
How long did it take you to
figure it out this time?

175
00:07:43,323 --> 00:07:45,992
I was really hoping not to
have this conversation again,

176
00:07:45,994 --> 00:07:48,078
but if you forgot
everything we went through,

177
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,233
I guess that means you died again.

178
00:07:50,235 --> 00:07:52,136
I died?!

179
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,218
"Again"?

180
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,454
And always say it just like that.

181
00:07:55,456 --> 00:07:57,155
We're the only two who remember,

182
00:07:57,157 --> 00:07:59,558
so each time you die
in one of these loops,

183
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,431
you don't remember
anything in the next reset,

184
00:08:01,433 --> 00:08:03,236
so then you have to learn
everything all over again.

185
00:08:03,238 --> 00:08:04,239
That's awful.

186
00:08:04,241 --> 00:08:06,229
It's annoying. 'Cause who
has to teach you every time?

187
00:08:06,231 --> 00:08:07,232
This guy.

188
00:08:07,234 --> 00:08:08,667
I've done it 14 times so far.

189
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:10,268
We've done this 14 times?

190
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,803
Oh, no. No, no, no.

191
00:08:11,805 --> 00:08:13,371
You've died 14 times.

192
00:08:13,373 --> 00:08:15,774
We've been through this loop 87 times...

193
00:08:15,776 --> 00:08:18,441
or I should say 87 that I know about.

194
00:08:18,443 --> 00:08:19,444
That you know about?

195
00:08:19,446 --> 00:08:22,113
'Cause you don't come
power me up every time!

196
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:23,682
It's okay. Not your fault.

197
00:08:23,684 --> 00:08:25,282
P.S., not a big fan

198
00:08:25,284 --> 00:08:27,118
of starting each loop powered down.

199
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,055
- Disconcerting.
- Why are we the only ones

200
00:08:29,057 --> 00:08:30,689
that are remembering these loops?

201
00:08:30,691 --> 00:08:32,091
Really not sure.

202
00:08:32,093 --> 00:08:33,127
You've had theories.

203
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:35,324
The latest was that we're the only two

204
00:08:35,326 --> 00:08:37,995
who start each loop in
a futuristic sleeping pod.

205
00:08:39,266 --> 00:08:41,199
Speaking of which...

206
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:42,367
No, I'm not ready yet. Th...

207
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:44,069
Nothing we can do.
You'll get used to it.

208
00:08:46,373 --> 00:08:49,307
Please come wake me up this time, 'kay?

209
00:08:54,514 --> 00:08:56,815
I've got damage to nearly all systems.

210
00:08:56,817 --> 00:08:58,918
Shut the door! Sparks!

211
00:09:04,324 --> 00:09:06,158
Okay. Where were we?

212
00:09:07,059 --> 00:09:08,326
The Time Drive is stuck.

213
00:09:08,328 --> 00:09:10,894
It keeps looping back on
itself over and over again.

214
00:09:10,896 --> 00:09:12,063
Like feedback?

215
00:09:12,065 --> 00:09:14,099
I've been thinking about
it like a record skipping.

216
00:09:15,536 --> 00:09:17,486
Every time I say that,
you give me the same look.

217
00:09:17,488 --> 00:09:19,756
Vinyl's back. You're supposed
to know records again.

218
00:09:23,443 --> 00:09:25,078
- What about flying out?
- We tried it.

219
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,178
No navigation, radiation
fried the controls,

220
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,980
and technically, space
is irrelevant here.

221
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:30,916
So we narrowed it down
to fixing the drive.

222
00:09:30,918 --> 00:09:33,418
And we can't get far enough
before everything resets.

223
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,686
How many loops now?

224
00:09:34,688 --> 00:09:36,254
90. But who knows?

225
00:09:36,256 --> 00:09:37,522
Maybe 90th time's the charm.

226
00:09:37,524 --> 00:09:39,391
Is that you trying to be optimistic?

227
00:09:39,393 --> 00:09:41,953
- 'Cause it didn't work.
- Yeah, that... wasn't great. I'm sorry.

228
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:43,732
And we're running out of time.

229
00:09:43,734 --> 00:09:45,101
Another zinger.

230
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:47,799
You're serious.

231
00:09:47,801 --> 00:09:48,867
We can't just keep looping

232
00:09:48,869 --> 00:09:50,435
until we get everything exactly right?

233
00:09:50,437 --> 00:09:52,103
Practice making perfect?

234
00:09:52,105 --> 00:09:53,372
Oh.

235
00:09:53,374 --> 00:09:55,342
You haven't noticed the numbers.

236
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,845
You really are behind.

237
00:10:05,985 --> 00:10:07,552
It's me. Everywhere's nearby.

238
00:10:07,554 --> 00:10:09,220
I'm already here. I'll check it out.

239
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:11,587
Simmons? Are you seeing this?

240
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:12,689
- Yes...
- Time storm.

241
00:10:12,691 --> 00:10:14,292
I don't want to alarm anyone, but...

242
00:10:14,294 --> 00:10:16,461
Yep, time storm. Yeah, that's right.

243
00:10:16,463 --> 00:10:17,933
Approaching the vortex,
circling the drain.

244
00:10:17,935 --> 00:10:19,997
- How far away are we?
- 79 kilometers.

245
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:21,299
Thanks for asking.

246
00:10:24,071 --> 00:10:26,100
He's saying 79, but it was 94.

247
00:10:26,102 --> 00:10:27,606
Used to be a lot more than that.

248
00:10:27,608 --> 00:10:30,175
Each loop resets us, but
it also brings the Zephyr

249
00:10:30,177 --> 00:10:32,576
a little closer to the
vortex and destruction.

250
00:10:32,578 --> 00:10:33,843
We're gonna run out of loops.

251
00:10:33,845 --> 00:10:35,479
See above re: "Let's do this fast".

252
00:10:35,481 --> 00:10:38,016
Okay, so, if the problem is
that we never solve the riddle

253
00:10:38,018 --> 00:10:40,318
before time runs out, that
means we have two options...

254
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,652
we increase the time we have...

255
00:10:41,654 --> 00:10:44,577
We tried that during
loops 23 through 42-ish.

256
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:46,124
- Dead end.
- ... or we solve faster.

257
00:10:46,126 --> 00:10:47,325
Yes.

258
00:10:47,327 --> 00:10:48,727
Got any thoughts on how to do that?

259
00:10:50,364 --> 00:10:52,254
I've got damage to nearly all systems.

260
00:10:52,256 --> 00:10:53,757
Trying to get a read on our location.

261
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:55,392
Guys... stop!

262
00:10:56,203 --> 00:10:57,335
Listen to me.

263
00:10:57,337 --> 00:10:58,903
We are repeating time.

264
00:10:58,905 --> 00:11:01,172
Sparks, Yo-Yo, Simmons, Deke.

265
00:11:02,843 --> 00:11:05,942
Looks like something just fried
the Quinjet's flight system.

266
00:11:05,944 --> 00:11:06,945
Okay.

267
00:11:06,947 --> 00:11:08,747
You nearby?

268
00:11:08,749 --> 00:11:10,682
- Hey, it's me. Everywhere's nearby.
- "Hey, it's me. Everywhere's nearby".

269
00:11:10,684 --> 00:11:13,804
- I'm already here. I'll check it out.
- "I'm already here. I'll check it out".

270
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,825
"Radiation levels are off the charts".

271
00:11:16,827 --> 00:11:18,456
Radiation levels are off the charts.

272
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,491
We need to get out of this.

273
00:11:19,493 --> 00:11:21,192
And Deke, who doesn't
want to alarm anyone.

274
00:11:21,194 --> 00:11:23,194
I don't want to alarm anyone,

275
00:11:23,196 --> 00:11:25,264
but we're trapped in a time storm.

276
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,666
See?

277
00:11:27,668 --> 00:11:29,202
I know the future.

278
00:11:29,204 --> 00:11:30,571
Let's talk.

279
00:11:33,707 --> 00:11:35,874
We're 65 kilometers away
from the vortex already.

280
00:11:35,876 --> 00:11:38,009
I don't know how many more
loops that means we have.

281
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:39,544
I'm guessing not many.

282
00:11:39,546 --> 00:11:42,004
Deke, is there any other information
on the Drive we can find?

283
00:11:42,006 --> 00:11:44,174
Anything Fitz might have left behind?

284
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,685
Let me check.

285
00:11:46,687 --> 00:11:49,187
I'll be right back. It's...
It's, uh, hard to access.

286
00:11:51,391 --> 00:11:52,724
A loop?

287
00:11:52,726 --> 00:11:55,326
You're the one with the Time
Drive knowledge to fix it.

288
00:11:55,328 --> 00:11:57,962
Without that implant in
place, we could solve this.

289
00:11:57,964 --> 00:11:59,192
We don't know that.

290
00:11:59,194 --> 00:12:01,996
We can make a fairly educated guess.

291
00:12:02,836 --> 00:12:04,335
- Did you tell them?
- No.

292
00:12:05,572 --> 00:12:07,672
No. Never. Of course not.

293
00:12:07,674 --> 00:12:10,175
I promised that I would
keep your secret, and I did.

294
00:12:10,177 --> 00:12:14,079
But what if we could just
take it out temporarily?

295
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:15,413
They wouldn't need to know,

296
00:12:15,415 --> 00:12:17,515
and without that implant
blocking your memory,

297
00:12:17,517 --> 00:12:19,277
- maybe we could...
- Blocking your memory?

298
00:12:20,487 --> 00:12:22,754
That sounds like something
you should tell us about.

299
00:12:22,756 --> 00:12:24,256
You guys followed me?

300
00:12:24,258 --> 00:12:25,523
We don't have time for secrets.

301
00:12:25,525 --> 00:12:27,155
An... An implant?

302
00:12:27,157 --> 00:12:29,158
I told you, we can never
know where Fitz is.

303
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,161
This ensures I don't.

304
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:31,542
We would never betray Fitz.

305
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:33,178
Nor would I, but the Chronicoms can

306
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,515
get the information from us
whether we want them to or not.

307
00:12:35,517 --> 00:12:36,634
And if the stakes weren't so high,

308
00:12:36,636 --> 00:12:38,002
we wouldn't need to take that risk,

309
00:12:38,004 --> 00:12:39,537
but we have to know what you know.

310
00:12:41,575 --> 00:12:43,720
Fitz wouldn't want us to
sacrifice ourselves for him.

311
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:45,545
- I know that.
- Okay, think about this...

312
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:47,812
once we get the answer,
the loop will reset,

313
00:12:47,814 --> 00:12:49,715
and the implant will be back in place.

314
00:12:52,252 --> 00:12:53,418
Do you have any proof

315
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,087
this loop thing is actually happening?

316
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:59,290
Think of a fake word
and just say it out loud.

317
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:00,392
Anything.

318
00:13:02,395 --> 00:13:03,628
Phlebotinum. Phlebotinum.

319
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,698
Yeah, this isn't the
first time we did that.

320
00:13:07,901 --> 00:13:10,468
Okay. Let's go, before I change my mind.

321
00:13:11,605 --> 00:13:15,006
Only I can enter
authorization to remove it.

322
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:19,411
Okay.

323
00:13:20,447 --> 00:13:21,447
Here we go.

324
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,920
Let's try that again.

325
00:13:31,158 --> 00:13:32,256
Are you okay?

326
00:13:32,258 --> 00:13:34,125
I can't bre... I...

327
00:13:34,127 --> 00:13:36,060
S-Simmons. Simmons!

328
00:13:36,062 --> 00:13:37,428
I'm going in there!

329
00:13:39,099 --> 00:13:40,965
How did these doors become locked?

330
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:42,834
Simmons, open the door!

331
00:13:42,836 --> 00:13:44,636
- Simmons, open the door!
- Open the door!

332
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,573
Simmons...

333
00:14:01,621 --> 00:14:03,092
Phlebotinum.

334
00:14:03,094 --> 00:14:05,229
Okay. Let's go, before I change my mind.

335
00:14:05,231 --> 00:14:07,071
But this time, I'll be
going in there with you.

336
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:09,395
This time?

337
00:14:10,664 --> 00:14:12,887
So if whatever went wrong
with that thing last time

338
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:13,965
happens again,

339
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:15,667
she can get you away from it.

340
00:14:17,037 --> 00:14:18,603
Okay, talk me through this.

341
00:14:18,605 --> 00:14:20,905
Um... never actually done this before.

342
00:14:20,907 --> 00:14:22,841
Cool.

343
00:14:22,843 --> 00:14:24,610
Cool, cool, cool.

344
00:14:34,654 --> 00:14:36,354
It's gas.

345
00:14:36,356 --> 00:14:38,122
- It's gas.
- I'm going in there!

346
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:40,625
- Open the door!
- Open it!

347
00:14:40,627 --> 00:14:43,247
- How did these doors become locked?
- Open the door!

348
00:14:44,331 --> 00:14:45,997
Open it!

349
00:14:56,142 --> 00:14:57,775
They're dead.

350
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:01,512
What a pain in the ass.

351
00:15:05,886 --> 00:15:08,519
This does not appear to be
a naturally occurring leak.

352
00:15:08,521 --> 00:15:10,855
The cut is too neat and precise,

353
00:15:10,857 --> 00:15:13,525
as though it was made with a knife.

354
00:15:14,761 --> 00:15:16,127
This was no accident.

355
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:17,996
It was deliberate.

356
00:15:17,998 --> 00:15:19,430
Almost as if it was...

357
00:15:19,432 --> 00:15:21,599
Murder. Yeah. We get it.

358
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:39,232
Hey. What are you doing up?

359
00:15:39,234 --> 00:15:40,501
Did we jump again?

360
00:15:41,283 --> 00:15:43,669
I'd say we're about 48 kilometers
away from the vortex.

361
00:15:43,671 --> 00:15:45,071
Aah!

362
00:15:45,073 --> 00:15:46,139
Mack!

363
00:15:46,141 --> 00:15:47,238
I'm sure it looks worse than it is.

364
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,775
You're literally blind.

365
00:15:50,111 --> 00:15:51,476
Is that supposed to...

366
00:15:58,987 --> 00:16:00,319
Huh.

367
00:16:00,321 --> 00:16:01,621
Wait. I died?!

368
00:16:01,623 --> 00:16:02,655
"Again"?

369
00:16:02,657 --> 00:16:04,056
I know this is upsetting for you,

370
00:16:04,058 --> 00:16:05,725
but I really just want to
get back to the part

371
00:16:05,727 --> 00:16:07,093
where we're solving this again.

372
00:16:07,095 --> 00:16:08,828
Not to minimize your pain.

373
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,996
Fair.

374
00:16:09,998 --> 00:16:11,230
You didn't happen to catch

375
00:16:11,232 --> 00:16:14,066
how close we are to the
vortex this time around?

376
00:16:14,068 --> 00:16:16,969
I think Deke said it was,
like, 41 kilometers.

377
00:16:16,971 --> 00:16:19,105
We're running out of time.

378
00:16:19,107 --> 00:16:21,140
And someone here is willing to kill.

379
00:16:21,142 --> 00:16:24,110
Just to keep us from
unblocking Simmons' memory.

380
00:16:24,112 --> 00:16:25,278
I mean, I'd ask who,

381
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,515
but it's hard to ignore the
super-obvious suspects.

382
00:16:29,483 --> 00:16:31,017
So, you know about the implant?

383
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:33,321
Wait. What?! Did I tell you about it?

384
00:16:33,323 --> 00:16:34,823
Please say that wasn't me.

385
00:16:34,825 --> 00:16:35,859
The how doesn't matter.

386
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:37,557
What matters is that you
guys are protecting a secret

387
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:39,158
and someone tried to kill for it.

388
00:16:40,328 --> 00:16:41,828
And you think it was one of us?

389
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,529
To be fair, you were the one killed,

390
00:16:43,531 --> 00:16:45,231
so that makes you less of a suspect.

391
00:16:45,233 --> 00:16:47,800
Hang on. You think it was one of us?

392
00:16:47,802 --> 00:16:50,635
Yes, we want to protect Leopold Fitz,

393
00:16:50,637 --> 00:16:52,205
but killing seems

394
00:16:52,207 --> 00:16:54,106
rather shortsighted
and counterproductive.

395
00:16:54,108 --> 00:16:56,476
If we get pulled into
the vortex, we die, too.

396
00:16:56,478 --> 00:16:59,212
We know it doesn't make logical
sense, but someone did it.

397
00:16:59,214 --> 00:17:01,447
I just don't think they'd resort
to such drastic measures.

398
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:03,862
I mean, it doesn't make sense.

399
00:17:03,864 --> 00:17:05,498
Okay. I could look for
answers elsewhere.

400
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,153
We'll work on the Time Drive.

401
00:17:07,155 --> 00:17:09,089
That means removing
the implant, doesn't it?

402
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,823
I'll get the instruments.

403
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:14,627
Get it over with before
I change my mind.

404
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:21,100
I'm having a hard time believing
that one of us would kill the others.

405
00:17:21,102 --> 00:17:23,268
I don't believe it, either, but
we don't have the full story.

406
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,071
Maybe someone was brainwashed.

407
00:17:25,073 --> 00:17:27,073
Maybe someone was
replaced by a Chronicom.

408
00:17:27,075 --> 00:17:28,407
Wouldn't be the first time.

409
00:17:29,844 --> 00:17:32,979
Bottom line is, someone
killed Simmons and Daisy.

410
00:17:32,981 --> 00:17:34,847
I watched them die.

411
00:17:34,849 --> 00:17:36,983
I don't want to see that anymore.

412
00:17:36,985 --> 00:17:38,284
What about Yo-Yo?

413
00:17:38,286 --> 00:17:39,685
Wasn't her.

414
00:17:39,687 --> 00:17:41,353
She's been trapped
in the Quinjet each loop.

415
00:17:41,355 --> 00:17:43,155
No, I mean as a solution.

416
00:17:43,157 --> 00:17:45,658
Maybe she's fast enough to
get the implant out of Simmons

417
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,093
before someone can stop her.

418
00:17:47,095 --> 00:17:48,761
Can you get her out of the Quinjet?

419
00:17:48,763 --> 00:17:50,096
It's worth a shot.

420
00:17:50,098 --> 00:17:51,931
I'll try it on the next loop.

421
00:17:53,134 --> 00:17:55,753
Sorry to put you right to work
once we get you out of here.

422
00:17:55,755 --> 00:17:56,822
Don't be!

423
00:17:56,824 --> 00:17:59,205
I don't like the idea that
someone tried to hurt them.

424
00:17:59,207 --> 00:18:01,073
Right?

425
00:18:01,075 --> 00:18:03,042
I'm assuming it wasn't you, right?

426
00:18:03,044 --> 00:18:04,377
You'd tell me.

427
00:18:04,379 --> 00:18:07,607
I mean, Mack's been blind,
Simmons died a couple times.

428
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:09,181
It's hard to keep track.

429
00:18:09,183 --> 00:18:10,716
Sounds like I missed a lot.

430
00:18:10,718 --> 00:18:12,618
I was only in here for a few minutes.

431
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,987
Yeah.

432
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:16,289
How nice.

433
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,359
Ah.

434
00:18:20,261 --> 00:18:21,661
There we go.

435
00:18:23,765 --> 00:18:25,496
Okay. Tell me where to...

436
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:27,967
Son of a bi...

437
00:18:27,969 --> 00:18:29,836
- Phlebotinum.
- Phlebotinum.

438
00:18:29,838 --> 00:18:31,804
So, you're saying we've
tried this a couple times?

439
00:18:31,806 --> 00:18:32,838
More than.

440
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,440
I'll get the scanner.

441
00:18:42,951 --> 00:18:44,951
I've been looking for you.

442
00:18:44,953 --> 00:18:47,553
You should be resting. What
are you doing out of that bed?

443
00:18:52,992 --> 00:18:54,226
A time loop?

444
00:18:54,228 --> 00:18:55,928
Fun, right?

445
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,597
It's why I wanted to
stay with this team.

446
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:59,865
You ever have a day where
something crazy doesn't happen?

447
00:18:59,867 --> 00:19:01,167
It's been a while.

448
00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:02,535
Reminds me of my SSR days.

449
00:19:02,537 --> 00:19:05,122
We just need to get the implant out.

450
00:19:05,124 --> 00:19:07,239
Wait. It's a trap.

451
00:19:07,241 --> 00:19:09,443
- Well, we don't know that yet.
- No, we do.

452
00:19:09,445 --> 00:19:11,410
You said somebody obviously
went through the drawer,

453
00:19:11,412 --> 00:19:13,546
and Simmons was supposed
to get the scanner, right?

454
00:19:13,548 --> 00:19:15,780
Yeah, until I told her I was gonna do it.

455
00:19:15,782 --> 00:19:18,284
Every attempt so far
has been on Simmons.

456
00:19:18,286 --> 00:19:20,286
She's the one they're trying to kill.

457
00:19:20,288 --> 00:19:21,955
Maybe, but we still need the scanner.

458
00:19:21,957 --> 00:19:23,122
R-Right, but if I die,

459
00:19:23,124 --> 00:19:24,690
I'll just, you know, reset, no problem.

460
00:19:24,692 --> 00:19:27,159
If you die, you lose your memories,

461
00:19:27,161 --> 00:19:29,462
and we have to waste all this
time relearning everything.

462
00:19:29,464 --> 00:19:31,031
Time we don't have.

463
00:19:37,472 --> 00:19:40,039
So... it's fine.

464
00:19:43,845 --> 00:19:45,277
Sousa.

465
00:19:47,348 --> 00:19:49,215
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Sousa!

466
00:20:15,276 --> 00:20:18,411
We are no closer to
knowing who's doing this.

467
00:20:18,413 --> 00:20:21,747
Well, the upside is
we're making progress...

468
00:20:21,749 --> 00:20:22,982
thanks to Sousa.

469
00:20:24,218 --> 00:20:26,951
Someone keeps trying to kill our people.

470
00:20:26,953 --> 00:20:29,321
Why doesn't that piss
you off? It should.

471
00:20:34,996 --> 00:20:36,263
I'm sorry.

472
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:43,336
I don't like watching you die.

473
00:20:44,572 --> 00:20:46,605
I don't like watching any of you die...

474
00:20:46,607 --> 00:20:48,407
over and over.

475
00:20:48,409 --> 00:20:50,509
We will figure this out.
You know we will.

476
00:20:50,511 --> 00:20:53,612
Sure. But in the meantime,
it is soul-crushing.

477
00:20:53,614 --> 00:20:55,247
If I even have a soul.

478
00:20:55,249 --> 00:20:56,849
Don't talk like that again.

479
00:20:56,851 --> 00:20:58,350
Of course you have a soul.

480
00:20:58,352 --> 00:21:00,419
Don't say that.

481
00:21:00,421 --> 00:21:02,788
Don't say "of course".

482
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,090
I'm not who I was.

483
00:21:04,092 --> 00:21:06,125
I'm this thing.

484
00:21:06,127 --> 00:21:08,527
I was Max Headroom for a year.

485
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:09,729
And you know what?

486
00:21:09,731 --> 00:21:11,530
Being trapped in a time loop,

487
00:21:11,532 --> 00:21:14,200
watching my friends die,
helpless to stop it...

488
00:21:14,202 --> 00:21:16,035
it's not some time-space anomaly.

489
00:21:16,037 --> 00:21:18,270
It's a damn metaphor.

490
00:21:18,272 --> 00:21:19,839
This is my life now.

491
00:21:19,841 --> 00:21:23,204
Does it not occur to you
that I might know something

492
00:21:23,206 --> 00:21:26,979
about watching my friend
die over and over again?

493
00:21:28,516 --> 00:21:30,082
This is different.

494
00:21:30,084 --> 00:21:31,751
Is it?

495
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:41,727
I will watch all of you die, one by one.

496
00:21:41,729 --> 00:21:44,630
Everyone I love.

497
00:21:44,632 --> 00:21:47,500
Because someone decided I should.

498
00:21:50,404 --> 00:21:53,339
I'm a machine now.

499
00:21:53,341 --> 00:21:55,541
I have programming,

500
00:21:55,543 --> 00:21:58,178
programming which won't even let me...

501
00:22:00,414 --> 00:22:01,614
What?

502
00:22:02,984 --> 00:22:05,117
It's Enoch.

503
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:06,586
I beg your pardon?

504
00:22:08,156 --> 00:22:10,256
Simmons and Fitz wanted
to protect their secret,

505
00:22:10,258 --> 00:22:11,557
and they had you on their side.

506
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:13,425
You could have had
the power of suggestion

507
00:22:13,427 --> 00:22:15,361
programmed into you
without your knowledge.

508
00:22:15,363 --> 00:22:16,695
We would never pro...

509
00:22:16,697 --> 00:22:17,963
And because your memory's blocked,

510
00:22:17,965 --> 00:22:19,765
you wouldn't remember it, either.

511
00:22:19,767 --> 00:22:21,767
You could both genuinely
believe you're innocent,

512
00:22:21,769 --> 00:22:23,202
but I don't think you actually are.

513
00:22:23,204 --> 00:22:26,372
Enoch wouldn't do that. It...
It doesn't make any sense.

514
00:22:26,374 --> 00:22:28,474
Everyone on this plane is my friend.

515
00:22:28,476 --> 00:22:30,376
I would never harm any of you.

516
00:22:30,378 --> 00:22:31,777
Not willingly.

517
00:22:31,779 --> 00:22:34,246
But Simmons and Fitz are
protecting something big...

518
00:22:34,248 --> 00:22:36,015
maybe fate-of-all-humanity big.

519
00:22:36,017 --> 00:22:38,350
It's possible you were
programmed with the idea

520
00:22:38,352 --> 00:22:40,519
that nothing, not even
your friendship with us,

521
00:22:40,521 --> 00:22:42,488
should get in the way
of protecting humanity.

522
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,689
How do we know for sure?

523
00:22:43,691 --> 00:22:44,958
We test it.

524
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,693
Now, Enoch, if I'm wrong,

525
00:22:47,695 --> 00:22:49,963
you won't have any problem with this.

526
00:22:50,998 --> 00:22:52,365
Aah!

527
00:22:53,534 --> 00:22:54,834
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

528
00:22:54,836 --> 00:22:56,167
- Wait.
- Enoch, stop!

529
00:22:56,169 --> 00:22:58,537
I... cannot... stop.

530
00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:00,372
Enoch.

531
00:23:00,374 --> 00:23:02,242
Enoch, I don't want this!

532
00:23:02,244 --> 00:23:03,309
Explain!

533
00:23:03,311 --> 00:23:04,710
You programmed me

534
00:23:04,712 --> 00:23:06,879
to protect the implant at all costs,

535
00:23:06,881 --> 00:23:08,681
even if I had to kill.

536
00:23:08,683 --> 00:23:12,017
Even if I had to kill you.

537
00:23:25,399 --> 00:23:26,733
Oh, dear.

538
00:23:41,444 --> 00:23:42,610
Hey.

539
00:23:42,612 --> 00:23:44,144
What are you doing up?

540
00:23:48,651 --> 00:23:49,917
Why do you care?

541
00:23:52,588 --> 00:23:54,455
Because you don't.

542
00:23:58,594 --> 00:24:01,929
I have to do something, and...

543
00:24:01,931 --> 00:24:03,465
I don't know how.

544
00:24:05,034 --> 00:24:06,867
Maybe we don't have to stop him.

545
00:24:06,869 --> 00:24:09,170
If we can just get the memory
zapper out of Simmons

546
00:24:09,172 --> 00:24:10,371
without Enoch finding out...

547
00:24:10,373 --> 00:24:11,872
Then we never have to fight him.

548
00:24:11,874 --> 00:24:13,707
We can do that, right?

549
00:24:13,709 --> 00:24:16,611
You wouldn't ask me if there
weren't lives at stake, would you?

550
00:24:19,382 --> 00:24:20,581
Okay.

551
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:22,182
What can I do?

552
00:24:22,184 --> 00:24:24,650
I just think it's weird that you
need to be awake for this thing.

553
00:24:24,652 --> 00:24:26,620
Not uncommon for brain surgery.

554
00:24:26,622 --> 00:24:27,589
What?

555
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,956
Which this absolutely is not.

556
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:31,058
Just removing a little implant. So easy.

557
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,594
Guys, I think we've got a...

558
00:24:37,733 --> 00:24:41,368
Okay, see, where we went
wrong is we forgot...

559
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:44,038
Enoch starts each loop
going to Simmons in the lab.

560
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,673
So he overheard us talking.

561
00:24:45,675 --> 00:24:48,008
It's not a problem. Simple adjustment.

562
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:52,813
Hello!

563
00:24:52,815 --> 00:24:54,049
Agent Sousa.

564
00:24:54,051 --> 00:24:55,716
Say, uh, question for you...

565
00:24:55,718 --> 00:24:58,552
what time is lunch
served on this vessel?

566
00:24:58,554 --> 00:25:01,507
I believe we are all free to
dine at our own convenience.

567
00:25:01,509 --> 00:25:03,290
R-Really? 'Cause, see, often,

568
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:05,693
when you're on, say, a m-military ship,

569
00:25:05,695 --> 00:25:08,029
all of the soldiers will eat together.

570
00:25:09,732 --> 00:25:12,032
D-Does wonders for morale.

571
00:25:12,034 --> 00:25:14,168
You have been with us long enough now

572
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:17,271
to know that meals are not
taken in a group fashion.

573
00:25:17,273 --> 00:25:20,491
Is there some reason you
are creating false pretenses

574
00:25:20,493 --> 00:25:23,062
under which you might
keep me in this location?

575
00:25:26,115 --> 00:25:27,881
Quick. Let's get
things started before...

576
00:25:27,883 --> 00:25:29,617
well, that.

577
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:30,719
Sorry!

578
00:25:33,756 --> 00:25:35,623
Alright, well, stealth didn't work.

579
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:37,725
Let's try something more direct.

580
00:25:41,297 --> 00:25:42,663
Enoch. Hey.

581
00:25:42,665 --> 00:25:44,097
Funny thing...

582
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:46,467
we have a-a situation that we
wanted to talk to you about.

583
00:25:46,469 --> 00:25:49,703
- We think you're gonna laugh.
- Or just at least see the irony in it.

584
00:25:49,705 --> 00:25:51,672
He did not see the irony.

585
00:25:51,674 --> 00:25:53,674
No. He did not.

586
00:25:58,447 --> 00:25:59,580
Enoch.

587
00:25:59,582 --> 00:26:01,215
Jemma has something to ask you.

588
00:26:01,217 --> 00:26:02,783
Go ahead, Jemma.

589
00:26:02,785 --> 00:26:05,619
Enoch, I need you to
do something for me,

590
00:26:05,621 --> 00:26:07,004
but it is going to require

591
00:26:07,006 --> 00:26:09,590
countermanding an order I gave you.

592
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,594
In retrospect, I should have known

593
00:26:13,596 --> 00:26:16,630
I'd make countermanding that
order password-dependent.

594
00:26:16,632 --> 00:26:19,533
I think it's time we get
everyone in on the act.

595
00:26:25,341 --> 00:26:27,675
Enoch.

596
00:26:27,677 --> 00:26:29,176
We need to talk.

597
00:26:33,816 --> 00:26:35,149
That did not go well.

598
00:26:35,151 --> 00:26:37,451
Where'd he get all those weapons?

599
00:26:37,453 --> 00:26:38,686
Deke's dead?

600
00:26:38,688 --> 00:26:40,087
Very.

601
00:26:40,089 --> 00:26:42,656
Do we need to be sad about that?

602
00:26:42,658 --> 00:26:43,824
We do not.

603
00:26:51,367 --> 00:26:53,834
Hey. What are you doing up?

604
00:26:53,836 --> 00:26:56,937
Uh, well, believe it or not,
I am stuck in a time loop,

605
00:26:56,939 --> 00:26:59,807
and I'm running out
of ways to save us all.

606
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:01,242
Okay.

607
00:27:02,178 --> 00:27:03,445
How can I help?

608
00:27:04,213 --> 00:27:05,546
There's no time.

609
00:27:05,548 --> 00:27:06,880
There's...

610
00:27:12,555 --> 00:27:15,256
Actually... I can take a loop.

611
00:27:20,796 --> 00:27:22,563
So, that wasn't hard for you to swallow?

612
00:27:22,565 --> 00:27:24,733
The... The time loop?

613
00:27:25,868 --> 00:27:27,801
Nothing seems to faze you.

614
00:27:28,872 --> 00:27:31,806
It all fazes me...
just m-maybe not my face.

615
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:35,509
Every time I ask you
for help, you say yes.

616
00:27:35,511 --> 00:27:36,844
Even if I don't ask,

617
00:27:36,846 --> 00:27:40,547
you're waiting here to
make me rest or... whatever.

618
00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:42,450
W-Why?

619
00:27:43,886 --> 00:27:45,753
Be honest.

620
00:27:45,755 --> 00:27:47,188
Honest?

621
00:27:52,361 --> 00:27:53,560
I know your type.

622
00:27:53,562 --> 00:27:55,395
My what, now?

623
00:27:55,397 --> 00:27:57,464
I know people like you.

624
00:27:57,466 --> 00:27:59,501
Some of my favorite
people are people like you.

625
00:28:02,298 --> 00:28:05,233
Focused on the greater good,
even at your own expense.

626
00:28:05,235 --> 00:28:07,441
You want people to think
you like being alone,

627
00:28:07,443 --> 00:28:10,277
even though you always
end up back with friends.

628
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:11,779
You hate losing.

629
00:28:11,781 --> 00:28:12,946
Everyone hates losing.

630
00:28:12,948 --> 00:28:15,382
Yeah, but you'll keep running
at the problem full-tilt

631
00:28:15,384 --> 00:28:17,551
until you either solve it

632
00:28:17,553 --> 00:28:21,221
or slam headlong into a brick wall.

633
00:28:21,223 --> 00:28:23,056
Some of those walls are literal.

634
00:28:23,058 --> 00:28:24,750
I know.

635
00:28:24,752 --> 00:28:26,753
But how does that...

636
00:28:26,755 --> 00:28:30,597
Because when people like
you run into those walls,

637
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:32,867
you should have someone
there to pick you back up.

638
00:28:34,737 --> 00:28:37,571
And you...

639
00:28:37,573 --> 00:28:39,940
you like to...

640
00:28:39,942 --> 00:28:41,875
be that someone?

641
00:28:41,877 --> 00:28:43,812
Not for everyone.

642
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,774
It helps if they're fun to be around

643
00:28:48,776 --> 00:28:50,049
and if they say what they mean

644
00:28:50,051 --> 00:28:52,591
and if they have that superpower

645
00:28:52,593 --> 00:28:54,721
where they can rock things around,

646
00:28:54,723 --> 00:28:57,992
which is very impressive.

647
00:28:59,595 --> 00:29:01,128
That's, um...

648
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:03,463
that is awfully specific.

649
00:29:03,465 --> 00:29:05,766
Mm-hmm.

650
00:29:09,071 --> 00:29:12,506
So, what's this problem
you're trying to crack?

651
00:29:12,508 --> 00:29:15,009
You wouldn't ask me if there
weren't lives at stake, would you?

652
00:29:15,011 --> 00:29:16,076
No.

653
00:29:16,078 --> 00:29:17,110
Okay.

654
00:29:17,112 --> 00:29:18,478
What can I do?

655
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,848
Wait here. I'll go set up the procedure.

656
00:29:30,459 --> 00:29:33,925
Agent Sousa, you must not
remove Jemma Simmons' implant.

657
00:29:33,927 --> 00:29:35,194
Don't worry. I won't.

658
00:29:38,701 --> 00:29:39,968
Daisy will.

659
00:29:41,797 --> 00:29:43,865
I cannot allow that.

660
00:29:44,974 --> 00:29:46,441
We know you'll fight us.

661
00:29:47,543 --> 00:29:49,943
That's why there's four of us.

662
00:29:49,945 --> 00:29:51,144
You'll get by us...

663
00:29:51,146 --> 00:29:52,880
or at least that's what we hear...

664
00:29:52,882 --> 00:29:54,948
but it will take you a while.

665
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,884
Hopefully, just long enough.

666
00:30:00,522 --> 00:30:02,422
Come on, hurry up!
They're holding him off.

667
00:30:02,424 --> 00:30:03,590
This will work.

668
00:30:03,592 --> 00:30:04,892
It will, but it took too long.

669
00:30:04,894 --> 00:30:05,993
No, it'll work. It'll...

670
00:30:07,196 --> 00:30:08,862
Oh, come on!

671
00:30:08,864 --> 00:30:11,298
Next time, same thing, but faster.

672
00:30:22,044 --> 00:30:23,911
Hey. What are you doing up?

673
00:30:23,913 --> 00:30:26,380
Uh...

674
00:30:26,382 --> 00:30:27,916
I need you to do something for me.

675
00:30:29,184 --> 00:30:31,486
Of course. What do you need?

676
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:43,096
That was nice.

677
00:30:44,266 --> 00:30:46,066
Now we need to trap a space robot.

678
00:30:50,773 --> 00:30:52,673
Okay. What can I do?

679
00:30:52,675 --> 00:30:56,176
Wait here. I'll go set up the procedure.

680
00:30:58,533 --> 00:31:01,068
Alright. No messing around this time.

681
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:03,083
We're 11 kilometers from the vortex.

682
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:18,900
Okay.

683
00:31:20,255 --> 00:31:21,622
Are your memories coming back?

684
00:31:22,604 --> 00:31:24,805
What can we do to fix the Time Drive?

685
00:31:24,807 --> 00:31:27,074
We got about two minutes
to get the answer,

686
00:31:27,076 --> 00:31:29,775
assuming Enoch's still busy
with Sousa and the rest.

687
00:31:31,313 --> 00:31:33,180
Jemma?

688
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:34,414
You okay?

689
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:36,450
It's Enoch.

690
00:31:36,452 --> 00:31:38,085
He's the key.

691
00:31:38,087 --> 00:31:40,087
He's been against you, but he's the key.

692
00:31:40,089 --> 00:31:41,221
How?

693
00:31:41,223 --> 00:31:45,125
His Electrochron Displacement Mechanism.

694
00:31:45,127 --> 00:31:47,761
Chronicoms use it to
regulate energy stability.

695
00:31:47,763 --> 00:31:49,329
It could do the same for the Time Drive.

696
00:31:49,331 --> 00:31:51,131
It's compatible.

697
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:52,834
Great. Then let's get to it.

698
00:31:54,036 --> 00:31:55,770
It's not that simple.

699
00:31:57,406 --> 00:32:00,640
It would be like removing
a human being's heart.

700
00:32:00,642 --> 00:32:01,941
Taking it out would...

701
00:32:01,943 --> 00:32:03,977
Taking it out would kill him.

702
00:32:11,153 --> 00:32:12,786
Simmons?

703
00:32:12,788 --> 00:32:14,589
Simmons? Are you okay?

704
00:32:15,691 --> 00:32:18,358
What have I done?

705
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,760
Oh, my God.

706
00:32:22,164 --> 00:32:23,630
- I'm sorry.
- Jemma, what are you remembering?

707
00:32:23,632 --> 00:32:26,099
- What have I done?
- Jemma?

708
00:32:26,101 --> 00:32:29,036
- Oh, my God. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Jemma, what is it that you remember?

709
00:32:30,939 --> 00:32:31,972
No!

710
00:32:42,652 --> 00:32:44,541
I've got damage to nearly all systems.

711
00:32:44,543 --> 00:32:46,977
Trying to get a read on our location.

712
00:32:53,218 --> 00:32:55,151
Everything's gonna be okay.

713
00:32:55,153 --> 00:32:57,053
Trust me.

714
00:32:59,191 --> 00:33:00,924
Okay.

715
00:33:03,762 --> 00:33:06,964
Looks like something just fried
the Quinjet's flight system.

716
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,999
I'll check it out and let you know.

717
00:33:12,003 --> 00:33:14,037
Simmons.

718
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:17,073
I need you to meet me in the LMD lab.

719
00:33:17,075 --> 00:33:20,477
In a moment, Enoch's gonna join you.

720
00:33:20,479 --> 00:33:22,278
Bring him.

721
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,647
Alright.

722
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,284
How far are we from the vortex?

723
00:33:28,553 --> 00:33:30,220
Wha...

724
00:33:30,222 --> 00:33:32,522
We're less than one kilometer.

725
00:33:34,459 --> 00:33:35,558
Okay.

726
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,294
I need you to come with me.

727
00:33:46,772 --> 00:33:48,305
Are you okay? You sounded...

728
00:33:49,241 --> 00:33:50,507
Did you tell him yet?

729
00:33:50,509 --> 00:33:51,641
No. I was about to.

730
00:33:51,643 --> 00:33:53,042
Tell who what?

731
00:33:53,044 --> 00:33:55,178
The vortex outside is about to kill us,

732
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,546
but we are stuck in a time loop

733
00:33:56,548 --> 00:33:58,114
that is keeping us from breaking out.

734
00:33:58,116 --> 00:33:59,483
So we need to act fast.

735
00:34:00,585 --> 00:34:01,785
What do we need to do?

736
00:34:01,787 --> 00:34:04,521
You were the one who told us.

737
00:34:04,523 --> 00:34:05,790
Enoch has something called

738
00:34:05,792 --> 00:34:08,124
an Electrochron Displacement Mechanism.

739
00:34:08,126 --> 00:34:10,160
Yes.

740
00:34:10,162 --> 00:34:11,428
I understand.

741
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:13,062
I don't. How could I have told you?

742
00:34:13,064 --> 00:34:14,164
I don't even know what that is.

743
00:34:14,166 --> 00:34:15,232
You do.

744
00:34:15,234 --> 00:34:17,169
You forgot, but we helped you remember.

745
00:34:22,678 --> 00:34:25,909
Look, however they got there,

746
00:34:25,911 --> 00:34:27,911
if it's something we can
use in the Time Drive,

747
00:34:27,913 --> 00:34:29,312
then I can figure it out.

748
00:34:29,314 --> 00:34:30,981
But there's a risk.

749
00:34:33,185 --> 00:34:34,384
To Enoch.

750
00:34:34,386 --> 00:34:35,785
Which is why we're here.

751
00:34:35,787 --> 00:34:38,162
It is not an easy discussion to have.

752
00:34:38,164 --> 00:34:39,489
No, there has to be another solution.

753
00:34:39,491 --> 00:34:40,892
We have tried every possible angle.

754
00:34:40,894 --> 00:34:43,359
You can't just expect
Enoch to sacrifice...

755
00:34:43,361 --> 00:34:46,163
I believe this is what you need.

756
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,099
Enoch.

757
00:34:50,302 --> 00:34:52,535
What did you do?

758
00:34:52,537 --> 00:34:55,372
What needed to be done, apparently.

759
00:34:56,308 --> 00:34:58,241
Enoch, you'll die.

760
00:34:58,243 --> 00:35:00,110
And the rest of you will live.

761
00:35:01,346 --> 00:35:04,481
I would like to think Fitz
would do the same for me.

762
00:35:04,483 --> 00:35:07,016
I would like to think all of you would.

763
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:32,275
Mm.

764
00:35:38,049 --> 00:35:39,316
Oh, my.

765
00:35:41,292 --> 00:35:43,686
I do not feel at all well.

766
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,200
What do you think?

767
00:35:57,202 --> 00:35:59,335
There's no time to think.

768
00:35:59,337 --> 00:36:01,572
Deke.

769
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:04,874
I think I can do it.

770
00:36:04,876 --> 00:36:06,277
It's a good fit.

771
00:36:06,279 --> 00:36:08,447
Whosever idea this was,
she knew what she was doing.

772
00:36:10,852 --> 00:36:12,219
Okay.

773
00:36:12,221 --> 00:36:14,551
Just need to make...

774
00:36:14,553 --> 00:36:16,953
one more adjustment.

775
00:36:16,955 --> 00:36:18,254
Coulson, Daisy,

776
00:36:18,256 --> 00:36:20,123
Deke says he can get the drive working.

777
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:23,359
We should be ready to jump
out of the storm any minute.

778
00:36:25,931 --> 00:36:27,230
We'll let you know.

779
00:36:27,232 --> 00:36:29,065
Shouldn't you get to the Command Center

780
00:36:29,067 --> 00:36:30,366
for the jump?

781
00:36:30,368 --> 00:36:32,336
They'll be fine without us.

782
00:36:34,272 --> 00:36:35,940
Does it hurt?

783
00:36:37,216 --> 00:36:39,442
It does... a bit.

784
00:36:39,444 --> 00:36:43,446
But it's not the physical
pain that troubles me.

785
00:36:43,448 --> 00:36:45,715
I am acutely aware

786
00:36:45,717 --> 00:36:49,385
that in my thousands of
years observing humans,

787
00:36:49,387 --> 00:36:52,523
I never used to feel lonely.

788
00:36:54,426 --> 00:36:56,459
I have been alone many times.

789
00:36:56,461 --> 00:36:57,894
To be candid, I preferred it.

790
00:36:57,896 --> 00:36:59,930
But it wasn't until I met

791
00:36:59,932 --> 00:37:04,060
this particular team
of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents

792
00:37:04,062 --> 00:37:08,366
that being alone meant...

793
00:37:08,368 --> 00:37:11,470
feeling lonely.

794
00:37:11,472 --> 00:37:13,906
And I don't care for it.

795
00:37:13,908 --> 00:37:16,805
So...

796
00:37:16,807 --> 00:37:19,909
I am feeling, as you might expect,

797
00:37:19,911 --> 00:37:21,618
some anxiety now.

798
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:24,754
You don't have to.

799
00:37:24,756 --> 00:37:27,323
You're not alone.

800
00:37:27,325 --> 00:37:30,493
Daisy and I will stay with
you right up to the end.

801
00:37:33,932 --> 00:37:35,865
That is very kind of you.

802
00:37:35,867 --> 00:37:38,668
But...

803
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,403
it's that last part, isn't it?

804
00:37:40,405 --> 00:37:43,139
You can stay with me up to the end,

805
00:37:43,141 --> 00:37:45,375
but you can't come with me at the end.

806
00:37:45,377 --> 00:37:47,977
I will have to leave you.

807
00:37:47,979 --> 00:37:50,806
And I will have to do that alone.

808
00:37:50,808 --> 00:37:52,448
And I can't help wondering...

809
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:55,518
when that happens...

810
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,455
will I feel lonely?

811
00:37:59,717 --> 00:38:03,026
I can say with some authority

812
00:38:03,028 --> 00:38:04,627
that you're not wrong.

813
00:38:04,629 --> 00:38:07,130
Dying is lonely.

814
00:38:07,132 --> 00:38:09,866
But the feeling is temporary...

815
00:38:09,868 --> 00:38:13,099
at least for the person dying.

816
00:38:13,101 --> 00:38:15,738
The ones who are left behind...

817
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,340
less so.

818
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:23,190
I guess that's the one
advantage to going first.

819
00:38:23,192 --> 00:38:24,526
Yes.

820
00:38:26,885 --> 00:38:28,718
It's different,

821
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,788
watching your friends
go before you, isn't it?

822
00:38:33,224 --> 00:38:36,225
I have been through that, as well.

823
00:38:36,227 --> 00:38:40,432
It can be harder to stay than to leave.

824
00:38:43,369 --> 00:38:46,605
I'm sorry, Philip J. Coulson.

825
00:38:50,442 --> 00:38:52,909
Enoch...

826
00:38:52,911 --> 00:38:55,978
the team will carry on the mission.

827
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,581
We will survive because of you.

828
00:38:58,583 --> 00:39:00,283
Thank you.

829
00:39:00,285 --> 00:39:03,186
You are most welcome.

830
00:39:03,188 --> 00:39:05,922
But, Agent Johnson,

831
00:39:05,924 --> 00:39:09,826
while your friends will indeed survive,

832
00:39:09,828 --> 00:39:12,663
the team will not.

833
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:16,999
W-What do you mean?

834
00:39:18,837 --> 00:39:21,938
I have seen the future.

835
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,774
Carry on this mission and cherish it,

836
00:39:24,776 --> 00:39:28,444
for it will be your
last mission together.

837
00:39:28,446 --> 00:39:30,413
It...

838
00:39:30,415 --> 00:39:33,382
That's... That's not possible.

839
00:39:33,384 --> 00:39:35,284
I-I...

840
00:39:35,286 --> 00:39:38,387
Enoch, this is my family.

841
00:39:38,389 --> 00:39:40,223
Of course.

842
00:39:40,225 --> 00:39:44,961
Yet this is the nature
of family, isn't it?

843
00:39:44,963 --> 00:39:49,168
I have seen it countless
times on countless worlds.

844
00:39:50,401 --> 00:39:53,202
People arrive, so we celebrate,

845
00:39:53,204 --> 00:39:55,905
and people leave us, so we grieve.

846
00:39:55,907 --> 00:39:59,041
We do what we can with
the time in between,

847
00:39:59,043 --> 00:40:02,245
but the cycle is always there.

848
00:40:02,247 --> 00:40:03,946
No one escapes it.

849
00:40:05,518 --> 00:40:07,784
Not even me.

850
00:40:07,786 --> 00:40:09,553
Which means you're not alone.

851
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:14,957
You're a part of that cycle.

852
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:18,194
Like every other living thing.

853
00:40:21,499 --> 00:40:23,966
Fitz.

854
00:40:29,207 --> 00:40:31,542
He was my best friend.

855
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:36,580
And you were a good friend to Fitz.

856
00:40:37,949 --> 00:40:40,517
You were a good friend to all of us.

857
00:40:42,353 --> 00:40:45,054
As I have always...

858
00:40:56,568 --> 00:40:58,901
Jump successful, everybody.

859
00:40:58,903 --> 00:41:00,536
We're safe.

860
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:20,210
Don't overthink it.

861
00:41:20,212 --> 00:41:23,380
Let the energy flow through you.

862
00:41:23,382 --> 00:41:25,248
Let it fill you up.

863
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:29,953
And then... send it
where you want it to go.

864
00:41:35,694 --> 00:41:36,792
Brava!

865
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:39,129
My friend, Brava.

866
00:41:39,131 --> 00:41:41,799
I've spent years feeling dangerous.

867
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,270
This is the first time I've liked it.

868
00:41:47,272 --> 00:41:48,640
Good.

869
00:41:51,947 --> 00:41:55,650
You know, your little sister
is gonna be so impressed.
