00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:05,018
Excuse me, something
is happening...

3
00:04:05,727 --> 00:04:06,892
What the...?

4
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:51,642
It's him!

5
00:06:52,935 --> 00:06:55,268
Get him up!
Why the hell are you so weak?

6
00:06:56,227 --> 00:06:58,977
- Pilot, get him to the stairs!
- Come on!

7
00:07:28,685 --> 00:07:29,893
Hurry!

8
00:07:34,101 --> 00:07:36,934
- Move your feet!
- He's shell-shocked!

9
00:08:01,267 --> 00:08:03,809
Freaking Astronomer,
it's impossible to understand.

10
00:08:03,852 --> 00:08:05,019
Come on!

11
00:08:05,643 --> 00:08:06,685
Hurry!

12
00:08:07,684 --> 00:08:09,350
Just follow us,
understand?

13
00:08:16,102 --> 00:08:17,602
Come on, jump!

14
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,559
Hurry!

15
00:09:07,852 --> 00:09:09,685
Let's go!

16
00:09:34,185 --> 00:09:35,935
Come on.

17
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,061
That's it.

18
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,768
We're done for.

19
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:48,893
Told you so.
Told you...

20
00:10:00,727 --> 00:10:01,851
Don't...

21
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:20,309
We're out of time!

22
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,935
Off you go.

23
00:10:25,851 --> 00:10:27,851
I can't carry you any longer.

24
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,726
Wait!

25
00:10:54,268 --> 00:10:56,101
Who the hell are you?

26
00:10:57,727 --> 00:10:59,560
Where are we going?

27
00:11:03,684 --> 00:11:05,643
You wanna stay?

28
00:11:36,142 --> 00:11:39,100
- What happened to me?
- How would I know?

29
00:11:39,768 --> 00:11:42,184
Car accident
or maybe an OD...

30
00:11:43,644 --> 00:11:45,310
Am I dead?

31
00:11:45,352 --> 00:11:46,809
Coma.

32
00:11:47,268 --> 00:11:49,267
You mean this is all
a dream?

33
00:11:50,017 --> 00:11:51,852
Memories.

34
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:55,184
- Whose?
- Everyone who's in a coma.

35
00:11:56,184 --> 00:11:59,643
Everyone who's in a coma
comes to the same place-- here.

36
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,809
Our brain creates
a field of memories.

37
00:12:01,852 --> 00:12:04,602
When in a coma, it switches off
and adjusts to this field.

38
00:12:04,643 --> 00:12:07,769
Like how a radio
picks up signals. Look.

39
00:12:09,185 --> 00:12:14,142
Buildings, objects, people...
Whatever we remember is here.

40
00:12:14,185 --> 00:12:17,726
Whatever we don't remember
simply doesn't exist.

41
00:12:17,768 --> 00:12:19,893
So there you have it.

42
00:12:19,935 --> 00:12:21,851
Memories...

43
00:12:46,726 --> 00:12:48,059
It doesn't makes sense.

44
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:50,811
What about the ones that...

45
00:12:50,851 --> 00:12:53,559
They aren't people. I'm
telling you, they're memories.

46
00:12:53,602 --> 00:12:55,560
Ok, and what about
those black creatures?

47
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:57,351
Are those memories, too?

48
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:58,934
Hold on!

49
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:03,559
Hold on.

50
00:13:16,892 --> 00:13:18,351
Soldier Fly!

51
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:22,101
Are you going to secure
the perimeter or should I?

52
00:13:22,142 --> 00:13:23,768
I already did.

53
00:13:23,811 --> 00:13:25,644
Do it again then.

54
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:30,892
Listen,
where are we going anyway?

55
00:13:54,975 --> 00:13:57,309
- Wait, does it fly?
- Get in already.

56
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,851
It's a wormhole.
That happens sometimes.

57
00:14:14,892 --> 00:14:16,643
Someone remembered the bus
near the building

58
00:14:16,684 --> 00:14:18,309
and someone else
in the field.

59
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:21,017
The memories are mixed up.

60
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:31,101
Where is he?
Where is Pilot?

61
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,018
He had to distract the Reaper
with a whistle.

62
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:37,975
We wouldn't have
gotten out otherwise.

63
00:14:40,686 --> 00:14:43,727
- You left... You left him?!
- Hey!

64
00:14:43,976 --> 00:14:46,143
Didn't I tell you how
dangerous that district is?

65
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,018
And that map was bullshit.

66
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,018
There wasn't enough time,
I told you.

67
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:52,017
You were rushing me!
Everything has changed there.

68
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,602
Why did we have to go there
in the first place?

69
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:01,018
I'm absolutely sure...

70
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,892
...it was worth it.

71
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,935
Fly, show him around.
And get him settled in upstairs.

72
00:15:13,727 --> 00:15:14,893
Let's go.

73
00:15:22,102 --> 00:15:24,143
The show's over!
Chop-chop!

74
00:15:24,184 --> 00:15:27,059
Tank, what's up
with the trail?

75
00:15:27,102 --> 00:15:28,601
Are you waiting for the Reapers
to come over?

76
00:15:28,644 --> 00:15:29,226
Blow it up already!

77
00:15:29,268 --> 00:15:30,767
But we're running low
on explosives.

78
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,309
We need to ration.

79
00:15:32,352 --> 00:15:35,142
Ration my ass.
Didn't you see how they jump?

80
00:15:40,267 --> 00:15:43,268
We blow up all the trails
around the building.

81
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:46,643
But someone always remembers
them, so they reappear again.

82
00:15:46,685 --> 00:15:48,059
In order to stop the Reapers,

83
00:15:48,101 --> 00:15:49,935
we always have to be
on high alert.

84
00:15:49,977 --> 00:15:51,726
We take turns keeping watch.

85
00:15:53,101 --> 00:15:57,226
Yan says there's a whole island
here in Coma free of Reapers.

86
00:15:57,644 --> 00:16:00,851
We're always looking for those
who can help us get there.

87
00:16:01,102 --> 00:16:03,892
He's very certain about you
for some reason.

88
00:16:03,935 --> 00:16:05,227
You need to eat
and drink here.

89
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:07,268
Hunger and cold
are all memories

90
00:16:07,309 --> 00:16:09,268
but everything is like
in reality,

91
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,143
so we have to go outside.

92
00:16:11,184 --> 00:16:13,559
Those from the squad with
abilities are sent there.

93
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:16,101
- I don't remember my name.
- Nobody does.

94
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,102
By the way,
give yourself a nickname

95
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,851
before somebody else does.

96
00:16:18,892 --> 00:16:21,184
- It's just a dream.
- Let's go.

97
00:16:21,226 --> 00:16:22,559
To wake up,
it's just a room...

98
00:16:22,601 --> 00:16:23,643
Hey!

99
00:16:24,142 --> 00:16:26,934
Someone just died
to save you.

100
00:16:27,643 --> 00:16:29,892
You can't wake up.
Do you understand?

101
00:16:29,934 --> 00:16:31,976
Your body is in a coma
somewhere. You're here.

102
00:16:32,018 --> 00:16:33,767
There's nothing you
can do about it.

103
00:16:46,101 --> 00:16:48,310
And what is that?

104
00:16:52,142 --> 00:16:53,935
Dreams.

105
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,851
They materialize
while we're asleep.

106
00:16:56,893 --> 00:16:59,310
This way we can remember
something from reality.

107
00:17:00,934 --> 00:17:02,601
You'll get used to it.

108
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:07,017
Gnome lives there,
Tank, then Spirit,

109
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,059
Astronomer, me and Phantom.
The rest live downstairs.

110
00:17:09,102 --> 00:17:11,102
You'll receive clothes
and ammo from Tank.

111
00:17:11,143 --> 00:17:13,268
You and Phantom
are together?

112
00:17:13,726 --> 00:17:15,017
What?

113
00:17:26,101 --> 00:17:27,767
It's empty.

114
00:17:28,227 --> 00:17:31,269
Spend a couple of weeks here
and it'll start to take shape.

115
00:17:31,642 --> 00:17:33,601
It's yours.
Go inside.

116
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:40,309
Usually a newcomer
goes through an initiation.

117
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:43,685
But Yan decided to put you here
with the squad right away.

118
00:17:43,725 --> 00:17:48,269
Ah, the man from the balcony.
Is he a leader of some sort?

119
00:17:48,643 --> 00:17:51,060
He's been living here
longer than anybody else.

120
00:17:51,602 --> 00:17:53,269
He's left Coma once.

121
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,977
That's why we know
what this world is like.

122
00:17:55,018 --> 00:17:56,726
He taught us how
to survive here.

123
00:17:56,768 --> 00:17:58,893
We owe him our lives.

124
00:17:58,934 --> 00:18:00,767
Including you.

125
00:18:02,935 --> 00:18:04,561
Ok, get some rest.

126
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,934
We'll see what you're
made of tomorrow.

127
00:18:11,976 --> 00:18:14,144
And Phantom and I
are not together.

128
00:18:14,684 --> 00:18:17,601
- I didn't mean to...
- Even though he thinks we are.

129
00:18:18,143 --> 00:18:20,102
That's not how it is.

130
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,643
Wow!

131
00:20:32,184 --> 00:20:34,601
Looks like you really
are a phenomenon.

132
00:20:36,185 --> 00:20:38,060
Don't even think
of going there.

133
00:20:39,226 --> 00:20:42,600
Dreams are tricky.
You can get lost.

134
00:20:43,311 --> 00:20:45,643
You won't be able
to get out of there.

135
00:20:45,685 --> 00:20:48,144
So, how are you?
Are you settling in ok?

136
00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:51,727
- I guess so.
- Don't bullshit me.

137
00:20:53,102 --> 00:20:54,976
Everyone goes crazy
at first in here.

138
00:20:55,018 --> 00:20:58,185
Listen, I was a little hard
on you back there.

139
00:21:00,184 --> 00:21:03,268
- No hard feelings, ok?
- Yeah, all good.

140
00:21:05,018 --> 00:21:06,226
Peace?

141
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:09,269
Peace.

142
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,727
You see,

143
00:21:12,685 --> 00:21:15,768
Yan is trying to
find this island of his.

144
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:18,102
Points out to some
chosen ones.

145
00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:22,727
It's not my business really.
I'm not against it.

146
00:21:22,767 --> 00:21:27,269
I have people to take care of.
The discipline, subordination...

147
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,809
I understand.
Got it.

148
00:21:31,102 --> 00:21:32,727
Good man.

149
00:21:34,351 --> 00:21:36,144
I liked you from the start.

150
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:39,019
You're smarter
than the others.

151
00:21:40,018 --> 00:21:42,184
So stay away from my girl.

152
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:44,642
I like her.

153
00:21:45,601 --> 00:21:47,809
She's acting out.

154
00:21:48,184 --> 00:21:51,268
But that's ok.
We're almost there.

155
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,351
Well, I wouldn't say that.

156
00:22:00,184 --> 00:22:04,224
Yan might see
something in you.

157
00:22:03,268 --> 00:22:07,350
But he's made
mistakes in the past.

158
00:22:10,727 --> 00:22:14,269
And again,
I lead the squad.

159
00:22:14,768 --> 00:22:16,311
Not him.

160
00:22:16,852 --> 00:22:20,269
We're supposed to be friends,
and you're rude.

161
00:22:20,977 --> 00:22:24,226
No, I just wanted to say that
she should decide for herself.

162
00:22:29,852 --> 00:22:32,768
You haven't figured
shit out yet.

163
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,602
- Stand up.
- What for?

164
00:22:39,018 --> 00:22:40,976
Stand up, soldier!

165
00:22:42,685 --> 00:22:45,183
Chop-chop!

166
00:22:44,601 --> 00:22:47,809
Everyone's tired
of waiting for you.

167
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:09,767
Some people develop unique
abilities here in Coma.

168
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,810
It all depends on
their way of thinking

169
00:23:11,851 --> 00:23:13,976
and predisposition.

170
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:17,852
Spirit, for instance,
senses Reapers from afar

171
00:23:17,893 --> 00:23:19,684
and invokes ghosts.

172
00:23:19,726 --> 00:23:21,726
Astronomer draws the routes.

173
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:24,269
Pilot can locate
real people in Coma.

174
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:25,768
In order to discover
those abilities,

175
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:27,977
a person needs a push.

176
00:23:28,851 --> 00:23:30,851
Needs to be put in danger.

177
00:23:47,102 --> 00:23:49,226
Let's see why you
are so special.

178
00:23:50,268 --> 00:23:51,977
Gnome, launch a half!

179
00:24:13,934 --> 00:24:16,018
Hey!
Get it together!

180
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,393
Do something!

181
00:24:32,934 --> 00:24:34,893
So far so bad.

182
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:39,060
But you know,
often the abilities...

183
00:24:39,726 --> 00:24:42,059
...flourish in real combat.
There, outside.

184
00:24:42,102 --> 00:24:44,060
That's how it happened to me,
for instance.

185
00:24:44,768 --> 00:24:47,810
But we aren't animals who put
you in real combat right away.

186
00:24:48,726 --> 00:24:50,769
Gnome has built me...

187
00:24:51,268 --> 00:24:53,267
...a training machine.

188
00:24:53,642 --> 00:24:55,018
Bring out your dummy,
Gnome!

189
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:02,727
I said, bring it out.

190
00:25:51,018 --> 00:25:53,018
It's the enemy!
Attack!

191
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,934
Fight!

192
00:26:04,061 --> 00:26:05,976
Fight!
You can do it!

193
00:26:38,643 --> 00:26:40,768
So you can't act
on anything?

194
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:52,225
What did you do for a living?

195
00:26:52,936 --> 00:26:55,225
I was an architect,
I think.

196
00:26:56,768 --> 00:26:59,352
Cable!
Take the rookie.

197
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:03,184
We've never had
an architect.

198
00:28:17,643 --> 00:28:20,142
Afternoon shift!
Wake up!

199
00:28:20,726 --> 00:28:24,017
Afternoon shift!
Get to work!

200
00:28:47,185 --> 00:28:48,894
Higher!

201
00:28:49,601 --> 00:28:51,184
Ok, secure it!

202
00:28:57,726 --> 00:28:59,017
Cable!

203
00:28:59,059 --> 00:29:02,017
We're going to your submarine
to get the explosives.

204
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:03,810
Seems like we've cleared up
everything here.

205
00:29:03,852 --> 00:29:04,935
Get ready.

206
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:06,601
Yes, Commander!

207
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:12,100
Keep working, Architect.

208
00:29:13,727 --> 00:29:15,267
We don't need freeloaders.

209
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,602
Hey.

210
00:29:32,185 --> 00:29:34,769
Stop sitting around!
Who's going to work?

211
00:29:37,934 --> 00:29:39,601
Why are you upset?

212
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:42,267
You should be happy, you fool.
You're lucky!

213
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,310
And why am I lucky?

214
00:29:47,101 --> 00:29:50,934
You may not have these
valuable super powers, so what?

215
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:56,352
Look, there are plenty of us
who didn't pass the test.

216
00:29:56,644 --> 00:29:58,644
We were mistakenly picked.

217
00:29:59,102 --> 00:30:01,267
At least we don't
have to go out there.

218
00:30:01,935 --> 00:30:03,268
You'll be safer!

219
00:30:04,685 --> 00:30:06,934
So live your life!

220
00:30:06,975 --> 00:30:12,768
And you will come out of the
coma and continue on your path.

221
00:30:14,851 --> 00:30:17,184
But you will have to wait
for a while.

222
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:21,142
Time flows differently here.

223
00:30:21,935 --> 00:30:24,602
We're not entirely sure,
but it seems like...

224
00:30:25,268 --> 00:30:28,102
...it's no less than 1 to 100.

225
00:30:28,892 --> 00:30:31,850
One day in reality is equal
to several months in Coma.

226
00:30:31,892 --> 00:30:32,810
I've been here
for 15 years,

227
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:35,101
but you can live here
for thousands.

228
00:30:36,227 --> 00:30:38,102
The question is,

229
00:30:39,142 --> 00:30:41,643
how do you want
to spend these thousand years?

230
00:30:41,685 --> 00:30:44,934
You saved me.
Tell me what my purpose is here?

231
00:30:44,975 --> 00:30:46,893
It doesn't matter.

232
00:30:46,934 --> 00:30:49,684
Who you want to be
is for you to decide.

233
00:30:49,727 --> 00:30:52,060
You can move hardware
all your life

234
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:54,769
or you can develop
your abilities...

235
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,268
But sometimes...

236
00:30:56,684 --> 00:31:00,267
Sometimes it's hard to recognize
them in the beginning.

237
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,811
A person can feel like
he can do something

238
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:04,809
and then nothing
comes out of it.

239
00:31:06,602 --> 00:31:10,226
I think I finished
a building in town,

240
00:31:10,267 --> 00:31:12,892
but I don't know how.

241
00:31:12,934 --> 00:31:16,018
I tried to build something here
but it didn't work out.

242
00:31:20,226 --> 00:31:22,185
Phantom wasn't lying.

243
00:31:22,601 --> 00:31:25,309
Abilities can develop out there.

244
00:31:26,602 --> 00:31:29,726
We don't put the newbies
out there, too risky.

245
00:31:29,768 --> 00:31:33,142
But it's a personal choice.
In his case...

246
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:35,934
...it worked:

247
00:31:35,976 --> 00:31:38,060
superhuman strength, speed.

248
00:31:38,101 --> 00:31:40,101
He became a leader here.

249
00:31:40,142 --> 00:31:42,142
I've seen a lot of people
come through here

250
00:31:42,184 --> 00:31:45,184
and I think we're here
for a reason.

251
00:31:45,768 --> 00:31:49,767
Everyone who's here
didn't make it in reality.

252
00:31:50,726 --> 00:31:53,184
They didn't have
a future there.

253
00:31:54,685 --> 00:31:56,767
I don't remember
anything about myself.

254
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:59,018
Just some fragments
of memories.

255
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,059
Maybe that's for the best.

256
00:32:01,101 --> 00:32:02,559
In which way?

257
00:32:02,602 --> 00:32:03,935
Without the heavy burden
of memories,

258
00:32:03,977 --> 00:32:06,142
we can have a fresh start.

259
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:10,060
Nobody will tell you
who you are but yourself.

260
00:32:10,644 --> 00:32:13,060
This world is made
of our thoughts.

261
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:16,767
- The rules are slightly different here.
- Grip it firmly.

262
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,977
And here, unlike reality,

263
00:32:19,768 --> 00:32:22,268
one can achieve
whatever one wants.

264
00:32:29,143 --> 00:32:33,269
But that doesn't mean that
you should do nothing.

265
00:32:37,017 --> 00:32:39,226
The sight doesn't shift
anywhere. Got it?

266
00:32:39,269 --> 00:32:41,977
- Yeah.
- Get your palm closer to you.

267
00:32:44,102 --> 00:32:45,643
What do you want?

268
00:32:46,101 --> 00:32:48,101
I'm going with you.

269
00:32:48,143 --> 00:32:51,269
What?
You want to join us?

270
00:32:51,309 --> 00:32:52,850
Take the rookie.

271
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:57,309
What the fuck for?

272
00:32:57,351 --> 00:32:59,768
Because I said so.

273
00:33:01,018 --> 00:33:02,686
He'll get killed.

274
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:06,643
So be it. We have enough
people to move hardware.

275
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:14,851
So look...

276
00:33:15,601 --> 00:33:17,684
I got it, thanks.

277
00:33:19,851 --> 00:33:20,726
Astronomer...

278
00:33:20,768 --> 00:33:23,602
Excuse me,
can somebody give me a gun?

279
00:34:29,809 --> 00:34:32,268
There's Gnome's tunnel.
We turn there.

280
00:34:32,309 --> 00:34:34,351
Yes!
There's my tunnel.

281
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:42,185
I'm sorry,
but why is it "Gnome's tunnel"?

282
00:34:42,226 --> 00:34:44,268
Because I remember it.

283
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:48,226
And I remember that beauty
that we're on our way to see.

284
00:34:48,269 --> 00:34:50,561
This world is made up
of memories.

285
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,226
Sometimes it can be easy to
figure out who they belong to.

286
00:34:53,268 --> 00:34:55,809
Astronomer has this
whole theory about it.

287
00:34:55,852 --> 00:34:57,643
Ask him.
It's nuts!

288
00:34:57,685 --> 00:34:59,352
Tell us, Astronomer.

289
00:35:00,642 --> 00:35:02,725
- I heard you have a lot of them?
- Dreams?

290
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,934
- Yeah, in your room.
- Well, yeah.

291
00:35:06,351 --> 00:35:09,684
The coma separates
consciousness and body.

292
00:35:09,726 --> 00:35:13,810
We lose our memories here.
We lose ourselves.

293
00:35:13,852 --> 00:35:14,768
Get it?

294
00:35:14,809 --> 00:35:17,143
- So?
- But our dreams

295
00:35:17,184 --> 00:35:19,560
hold all the information about

296
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,226
what we've remembered
during life.

297
00:35:21,269 --> 00:35:25,809
Even this place, where we
are now, exists there.

298
00:35:25,851 --> 00:35:28,351
You can find yourself
dreaming there.

299
00:35:28,851 --> 00:35:31,268
Ah, so that way you can
come out of the coma?

300
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:33,018
What are you talking about?

301
00:35:33,268 --> 00:35:34,309
Yan told you.

302
00:35:34,352 --> 00:35:36,977
Anyone who tries to enter
the dreams won't make it.

303
00:35:37,017 --> 00:35:40,101
- What's so hard to get?
- Doesn't mean it's impossible.

304
00:35:40,143 --> 00:35:41,893
Did anyone
ask your opinion?

305
00:35:42,143 --> 00:35:42,934
Reapers!

306
00:35:50,309 --> 00:35:52,892
Nah, nah, nah.
It's safe.

307
00:35:52,934 --> 00:35:55,018
It's a two-day
detour from there.

308
00:35:58,018 --> 00:36:00,351
- Can they see us?
- They sense us.

309
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,309
We emit a signal,
a frequency.

310
00:36:04,018 --> 00:36:07,060
- That's why I made the whistle.
- What whistle?

311
00:36:07,102 --> 00:36:09,642
Just in case,
so we don't all blow up.

312
00:36:09,684 --> 00:36:12,101
- Only one of us.
- Like Pilot.

313
00:36:12,144 --> 00:36:15,309
You switch on the whistle
and it attracts the Reapers.

314
00:36:15,351 --> 00:36:18,351
Then you blow yourself up
with dynamite.

315
00:36:21,017 --> 00:36:22,684
If this world is made
of memories,

316
00:36:22,727 --> 00:36:25,143
how did they get here?

317
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:26,768
Through us.

318
00:36:30,017 --> 00:36:31,642
How?

319
00:36:32,851 --> 00:36:34,601
Coma patients.

320
00:36:35,017 --> 00:36:38,809
Their brain is dead
but life support is still on.

321
00:36:38,852 --> 00:36:41,144
The relatives are
against turning it off.

322
00:36:41,185 --> 00:36:43,685
The dead brain creates them.

323
00:36:44,019 --> 00:36:45,852
They die...

324
00:36:46,269 --> 00:36:48,685
...and decay all the time.

325
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:51,642
But they have the ability
to turn the living into

326
00:36:51,685 --> 00:36:53,810
the same black shit
they are made of.

327
00:36:53,852 --> 00:36:56,310
I'd rather be taken off the
machine than end up like that.

328
00:36:56,351 --> 00:36:58,727
Enough of that!
Let's go!

329
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:15,060
There's our main attraction!

330
00:37:27,685 --> 00:37:30,311
Architect,
did you bring spare underwear?

331
00:37:30,352 --> 00:37:33,019
Yeah, they're trigger-happy
with their guns.

332
00:37:33,059 --> 00:37:34,642
- Who?
- The guards.

333
00:37:34,684 --> 00:37:37,143
- Memories.
- Why would they shoot us?

334
00:37:37,184 --> 00:37:40,600
They shoot at strangers.
That's how I remembered it.

335
00:37:40,643 --> 00:37:42,727
Ok, take this.

336
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,768
Turn this and
it'll enhance your bio-signal.

337
00:37:47,018 --> 00:37:49,101
It'll attract the Reapers,
like bees to honey.

338
00:37:49,685 --> 00:37:51,227
- Got it.
- Don't worry.

339
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,102
There are no Reapers here.

340
00:37:53,144 --> 00:37:55,144
But don't start shooting
for no reason.

341
00:37:55,184 --> 00:37:56,684
You're so boring,
Astronomer.

342
00:37:56,727 --> 00:37:57,934
We run a greater risk
of dying from boredom

343
00:37:57,976 --> 00:38:00,184
than from the Reapers.

344
00:38:00,226 --> 00:38:02,143
Enough chewing the fat!

345
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,893
I'm leading.
Tank, stay behind and cover me.

346
00:38:04,935 --> 00:38:07,892
Spirit, distract them.

347
00:38:07,935 --> 00:38:09,269
The rest of you reserves,

348
00:38:09,311 --> 00:38:11,768
stay in the back
for your own safety.

349
00:38:12,227 --> 00:38:14,684
Any questions?
No questions.

350
00:38:14,934 --> 00:38:16,601
Let's go!

351
00:38:34,602 --> 00:38:35,310
Freeze!

352
00:39:08,102 --> 00:39:11,351
Did you work here?
What is this place?

353
00:39:11,393 --> 00:39:12,685
A lot of factories
are mixed up in here.

354
00:39:12,727 --> 00:39:14,685
Combined memories
of many people.

355
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,144
There!

356
00:39:16,602 --> 00:39:17,894
There's the hangar!

357
00:39:17,934 --> 00:39:21,060
I remember now!
There's a secret door.

358
00:39:21,767 --> 00:39:23,934
They will leave now.

359
00:39:23,977 --> 00:39:26,894
We have 30 seconds
to get there.

360
00:39:29,685 --> 00:39:31,851
Not yet, Phantom!
Phantom!

361
00:39:40,726 --> 00:39:42,019
Come on!

362
00:40:03,727 --> 00:40:05,227
- Come on!
- Freeze!

363
00:40:17,102 --> 00:40:19,018
Tank, throw a grenade!

364
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:22,268
- It's too far, I won't make it!
- You'll make it! Throw it!

365
00:40:53,185 --> 00:40:54,350
Tank!

366
00:40:54,727 --> 00:40:56,102
Cover me!

367
00:40:57,894 --> 00:40:59,810
Stay back, Tank!

368
00:41:48,935 --> 00:41:50,685
Whoo-hoo!

369
00:41:53,684 --> 00:41:54,935
Get down!

370
00:42:02,309 --> 00:42:03,642
Spirit!

371
00:42:19,061 --> 00:42:20,352
Here...

372
00:42:45,143 --> 00:42:46,352
Uh-huh.

373
00:43:07,769 --> 00:43:10,393
What the hell was that!

374
00:43:10,935 --> 00:43:13,100
You're going to get
us all killed!

375
00:43:15,142 --> 00:43:17,184
What the hell do you know?

376
00:43:18,351 --> 00:43:22,309
- Relax!
- We've summoned the Reapers here!

377
00:43:22,977 --> 00:43:25,894
- Spirit?
- I can't sense them yet.

378
00:43:30,351 --> 00:43:31,977
See?

379
00:43:32,768 --> 00:43:34,184
No one's gonna hurt you.

380
00:43:39,685 --> 00:43:42,352
If you ever shout
at me again,

381
00:43:42,392 --> 00:43:44,726
I will break you in half.

382
00:43:45,976 --> 00:43:48,684
I'm in charge here!

383
00:43:50,019 --> 00:43:52,351
Do you disagree?

384
00:43:52,393 --> 00:43:54,351
I can't hear you!

385
00:43:59,351 --> 00:44:00,769
Yes!

386
00:44:00,809 --> 00:44:02,059
Got it!

387
00:44:07,101 --> 00:44:08,810
You ok?

388
00:44:26,227 --> 00:44:29,100
I definitely don't
recall that.

389
00:44:34,601 --> 00:44:36,309
Each of those torpedoes
has explosives.

390
00:44:36,352 --> 00:44:38,268
That will last
for a month.

391
00:44:39,018 --> 00:44:40,685
Get to work.

392
00:44:41,184 --> 00:44:42,852
On it!

393
00:44:49,352 --> 00:44:51,977
Come on, come on!

394
00:44:52,018 --> 00:44:54,601
Come on!
Easy, easy!

395
00:44:55,602 --> 00:44:57,060
Easy!

396
00:44:57,101 --> 00:45:00,268
Slowly up!
Come on, come on!

397
00:45:09,685 --> 00:45:11,352
Let me heal it.

398
00:45:12,726 --> 00:45:13,852
It's nothing.

399
00:45:13,893 --> 00:45:16,184
Come on.
I'll check your hand as well.

400
00:45:16,894 --> 00:45:18,935
I said it's nothing!

401
00:45:24,018 --> 00:45:25,685
Thanks.

402
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:28,726
Careful!

403
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:30,768
Careful!
Hold it tighter!

404
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:35,601
Just a slight knock
and it'll blow everything up!

405
00:45:42,268 --> 00:45:43,976
Fucking Coma!

406
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:48,726
I recognize this.
It's some country...

407
00:45:49,227 --> 00:45:52,101
...but I can't remember which.

408
00:46:03,142 --> 00:46:04,726
What's up?

409
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:12,935
Everything is like
a dream here, right?

410
00:46:14,602 --> 00:46:16,185
A dream.

411
00:46:17,601 --> 00:46:21,267
You think you can grasp it...

412
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:32,017
- Reapers!
- I told you so.

413
00:46:34,059 --> 00:46:35,601
How far?

414
00:46:36,685 --> 00:46:39,644
- About a third of a mile!
- Get it down!

415
00:46:40,018 --> 00:46:41,769
I can't!

416
00:46:42,268 --> 00:46:44,310
One more minute!

417
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:46,934
- Get down!
- I said one minute!

418
00:46:46,975 --> 00:46:48,309
Freaking commander!

419
00:46:48,811 --> 00:46:51,310
- I'll finish it myself.
- Ok.

420
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:06,935
He won't make it.

421
00:47:06,975 --> 00:47:09,017
Are you happy now?

422
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:19,142
Hold it for as long as
you can, buddy. Got it?

423
00:47:22,643 --> 00:47:24,975
Gnome stays here,
the rest follow me!

424
00:47:25,017 --> 00:47:27,768
- He can't get it down by himself!
- Cable is up there!

425
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:30,101
No discussions,
obey the order!

426
00:47:30,142 --> 00:47:33,268
On three. One, two,

427
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:35,101
three. Run!

428
00:47:45,685 --> 00:47:47,809
Stop! Hold it!

429
00:47:56,018 --> 00:47:58,101
I said hold it!

430
00:47:58,892 --> 00:48:00,143
Run!

431
00:48:01,644 --> 00:48:02,935
Come back!

432
00:48:03,352 --> 00:48:05,310
- Come on!
- Come back!

433
00:48:10,769 --> 00:48:12,769
Everyone come back!

434
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,644
Fucker!

435
00:48:31,601 --> 00:48:33,351
Don't you dare!

436
00:48:59,934 --> 00:49:01,809
Move it to the exit.

437
00:49:02,726 --> 00:49:04,017
Hurry!

438
00:49:33,725 --> 00:49:37,268
So then I look,
you guys are running,

439
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:39,809
the stupid thing starts to slide
down, dragging me with it.

440
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:43,686
As I'm riding it,
I'm thinking, "This is it."

441
00:49:43,726 --> 00:49:47,351
But then the sparks,
this ramp... Boom!

442
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:52,560
My first thought was,
"I'm dead, it exploded."

443
00:49:52,602 --> 00:49:56,685
Who the hell knows how you trip
out while dying in a coma?

444
00:49:56,725 --> 00:49:58,684
Architect, you fool!

445
00:49:58,725 --> 00:50:02,184
Why didn't you run like the
rest? It was an order.

446
00:50:04,685 --> 00:50:06,310
That makes me think...

447
00:50:18,725 --> 00:50:23,101
That means you can build a wall
where necessary during combat?

448
00:50:23,892 --> 00:50:25,185
Yes.

449
00:50:27,018 --> 00:50:29,725
And maybe a bridge
of sorts?

450
00:50:32,852 --> 00:50:35,143
I guess a bridge as well.

451
00:50:42,017 --> 00:50:43,809
Attaboy!

452
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:47,184
You will be useful
for the unit, Architect.

453
00:50:49,184 --> 00:50:52,601
We'll get to places
we didn't dare think of before.

454
00:50:52,934 --> 00:50:54,767
And I'm thinking...

455
00:50:55,684 --> 00:50:58,852
...there's a better way
to use his abilities.

456
00:51:02,269 --> 00:51:04,143
We've been looking
for a hiding place

457
00:51:04,185 --> 00:51:05,852
from the Reapers
for a long time.

458
00:51:05,892 --> 00:51:07,809
An isolated place.

459
00:51:07,852 --> 00:51:11,810
But we couldn't, because people
not only remember a place,

460
00:51:13,184 --> 00:51:15,351
but how they got there,
as well.

461
00:51:15,851 --> 00:51:17,767
Isn't that right,
Astronomer?

462
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:22,685
But what if the place
wasn't created from memory,

463
00:51:22,935 --> 00:51:24,352
but rather from imagination.

464
00:51:25,059 --> 00:51:26,851
If it's created,

465
00:51:26,892 --> 00:51:30,268
designed like that ramp
on which Cable fell,

466
00:51:31,017 --> 00:51:34,852
then it isn't intertwined
with other memories.

467
00:51:35,227 --> 00:51:37,268
And therefore safe.

468
00:51:39,226 --> 00:51:40,893
I told you,

469
00:51:40,935 --> 00:51:43,600
I will bring you to the island.

470
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:46,143
And he will build it for us.

471
00:51:52,935 --> 00:51:55,852
You think he can do it?
A whole island?

472
00:51:57,726 --> 00:51:59,185
Can you?

473
00:52:09,184 --> 00:52:10,934
Um...

474
00:52:10,977 --> 00:52:12,685
Yes, I can.

475
00:52:15,934 --> 00:52:18,685
The best time to deploy
is right now.

476
00:52:20,059 --> 00:52:23,017
Yan, don't you want to
run it by me first?

477
00:52:23,268 --> 00:52:27,059
- We need time to prepare.
- What do you say, Astronomer?

478
00:52:28,809 --> 00:52:32,309
If we're deploying
along with the civilians,

479
00:52:32,767 --> 00:52:35,976
then we need to pick
the safest route.

480
00:52:37,226 --> 00:52:39,977
- We haven't had one in a long time.
- Hey, theorist!

481
00:52:40,017 --> 00:52:42,394
- It's all on paper, Yan.
- Didn't we...

482
00:52:42,851 --> 00:52:45,226
...clear all the explosives
in the area?

483
00:52:45,685 --> 00:52:48,226
Where will we go
when we run out?

484
00:52:48,684 --> 00:52:51,184
Sooner or later Reapers will
see the people through the bus.

485
00:52:51,227 --> 00:52:53,268
What then?

486
00:52:53,726 --> 00:52:55,227
We leave tomorrow.

487
00:52:56,893 --> 00:52:59,060
Astronomer will lead
the squad.

488
00:53:05,101 --> 00:53:06,184
Yan...

489
00:53:06,226 --> 00:53:10,184
Yan, I might've
overstepped today, but...

490
00:53:10,226 --> 00:53:13,059
You were reckless.

491
00:53:13,976 --> 00:53:15,642
Attracted the Reapers.

492
00:53:15,684 --> 00:53:18,059
That wasn't the agreement.

493
00:53:18,102 --> 00:53:19,852
It's my place!

494
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:24,727
This mission is way
too important.

495
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:27,685
Important mission?

496
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:30,810
Maybe they deserve
to know something more?

497
00:53:30,852 --> 00:53:33,018
We will talk later!

498
00:53:55,727 --> 00:53:58,102
Why aren't we drinking, huh?

499
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:07,143
Tomorrow is a big day.
Right, Architect?

500
00:54:49,102 --> 00:54:51,227
Damn it!

501
00:54:51,268 --> 00:54:53,018
What are you doing?

502
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:56,019
Shit, you scared me.
Nothing, just trying something.

503
00:54:58,934 --> 00:55:00,892
Trying to build?

504
00:55:01,976 --> 00:55:03,726
Well yeah, trying.

505
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:07,102
Can I watch?

506
00:55:07,143 --> 00:55:09,726
I'm almost done, actually.

507
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,851
It's not working out?

508
00:55:16,352 --> 00:55:18,185
No, not at all.

509
00:55:21,019 --> 00:55:24,144
Why did you tell everyone
you'll build that island?

510
00:55:30,269 --> 00:55:33,226
Back at the submarine
you called everyone back.

511
00:55:33,268 --> 00:55:35,767
You weren't sure
it would work.

512
00:55:36,351 --> 00:55:37,977
You could've killed everyone.

513
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:42,018
But it worked.

514
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:43,726
You've gotten by
so far without me...

515
00:55:43,768 --> 00:55:45,726
Just figure out
what went wrong.

516
00:55:45,768 --> 00:55:47,310
Wait!
You were concentrated.

517
00:55:47,351 --> 00:55:50,019
You did something with your
hands and something appeared.

518
00:55:50,059 --> 00:55:52,726
Yes, and the ramp appeared.
Why are you saying that now?

519
00:55:52,768 --> 00:55:54,894
No, the blueprint appeared.

520
00:56:05,642 --> 00:56:07,726
Appeared...

521
00:56:07,767 --> 00:56:09,851
The blueprint appeared...

522
00:56:12,851 --> 00:56:16,309
Yes, I need to imagine
the full blueprint.

523
00:56:16,934 --> 00:56:19,268
The full blueprint...

524
00:56:48,268 --> 00:56:51,101
So, which city should I build
for you on my island?

525
00:57:21,934 --> 00:57:24,977
They say you have a lot
of memories in your room.

526
00:57:25,852 --> 00:57:27,144
Well, yeah.

527
00:57:27,642 --> 00:57:29,726
I want to see them.
Will you show me?

528
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:38,852
How many there are!
I've got almost none.

529
00:57:38,894 --> 00:57:41,143
Meaning you don't
remember anything at all?

530
00:57:41,185 --> 00:57:43,143
Only a feeling.

531
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:45,726
Did you get into
a car accident?

532
00:57:45,769 --> 00:57:48,643
Yes, I was on my way
to an important meeting,

533
00:57:49,642 --> 00:57:52,185
but it turned out
to be a trap.

534
00:57:52,226 --> 00:57:53,935
An architect trap?

535
00:57:53,976 --> 00:57:56,101
Yeah, I agree,
it sounds crazy.

536
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,684
And this woman?
Were you close?

537
00:58:01,726 --> 00:58:02,934
I don't remember,

538
00:58:02,977 --> 00:58:04,643
and it's not important
anymore. I...

539
00:58:04,685 --> 00:58:07,894
- My life is here now.
- But you wanted to wake up so much.

540
00:58:07,935 --> 00:58:11,144
Yes, yes, I know. But...

541
00:58:12,894 --> 00:58:16,935
I met you and I can
become myself here.

542
00:58:16,977 --> 00:58:18,769
I feel that Yan is right.

543
00:58:18,810 --> 00:58:22,769
If we don't remember anything,
we can start a life over.

544
00:58:25,852 --> 00:58:28,602
And become someone who
we've always wanted to be.

545
00:58:28,643 --> 00:58:31,185
- Sounds silly, right?
- No.

546
00:58:34,684 --> 00:58:36,768
I feel the same way.

547
00:58:36,810 --> 00:58:38,685
Then you remember
something.

548
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:42,976
I do.

549
00:58:44,643 --> 00:58:47,310
I couldn't be with
the one I wanted.

550
00:58:49,768 --> 00:58:51,351
And here I can.

551
00:59:38,143 --> 00:59:39,352
During the mission,

552
00:59:39,392 --> 00:59:42,143
everyone should strictly
follow the leader.

553
00:59:42,685 --> 00:59:45,352
Don't deviate,
keep your distance.

554
00:59:45,392 --> 00:59:48,142
- Will we get guns?
- You don't need guns.

555
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:51,142
There are no Reapers
on that route.

556
00:59:51,185 --> 00:59:53,893
This is where
we'll build an island.

557
00:59:53,934 --> 00:59:56,100
We will go through the hills.

558
00:59:56,810 --> 00:59:58,685
They won't even notice us.

559
00:59:58,726 --> 01:00:00,768
What if you missed
some of them?

560
01:00:01,018 --> 01:00:02,143
I know them all.

561
01:00:02,184 --> 01:00:04,809
I've considered each one.
Spirit?

562
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:08,060
Seems about right.
Usually I sense them...

563
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:11,601
Phantom, listen.

564
01:00:11,643 --> 01:00:14,976
Should we take these
fuse wires for the explosives?

565
01:00:15,684 --> 01:00:17,142
Astronomer is leading
the squad.

566
01:00:17,184 --> 01:00:18,351
He's the commander now.

567
01:00:18,393 --> 01:00:20,019
Ok, got it.

568
01:01:43,143 --> 01:01:45,060
So, I've got a question.

569
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:48,352
What should I build
on this island?

570
01:01:48,894 --> 01:01:50,602
You're the architect,
so it's up to you.

571
01:01:50,643 --> 01:01:52,227
I do have one project,
but it's not mine,

572
01:01:52,268 --> 01:01:55,143
and the client would be
against me borrowing it.

573
01:01:55,769 --> 01:01:58,936
Oh, I think you can
tell him to go to hell now.

574
01:01:58,975 --> 01:02:01,267
- Well...
- I don't know what kind of project it is,

575
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:04,644
but you, Architect,
should build me a custom hut.

576
01:02:04,684 --> 01:02:08,809
- With a garage, you know?
- And a hot tub for me!

577
01:02:08,852 --> 01:02:12,810
- A shooting range for me!
- Ok, guys, chill! Let's form a line!

578
01:02:15,352 --> 01:02:16,811
Reaper!

579
01:02:29,894 --> 01:02:30,685
That's impossible.

580
01:02:30,727 --> 01:02:33,811
I've checked everything!
Are you sure?

581
01:02:34,143 --> 01:02:36,601
- I say what I sense.
- Damn it.

582
01:02:36,643 --> 01:02:38,893
It's always like that
with the Reapers.

583
01:02:40,309 --> 01:02:43,893
We won't make it far with
all this ballast, if at all!

584
01:02:44,352 --> 01:02:46,268
Should we turn back?

585
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:50,643
We won't get another chance
to get there any time soon,

586
01:02:50,685 --> 01:02:52,351
but it's up to you.

587
01:02:55,852 --> 01:02:57,310
Phantom.

588
01:02:57,727 --> 01:03:00,852
You've got more experience.
What do you think?

589
01:03:01,768 --> 01:03:03,810
We should split up,
check all directions,

590
01:03:03,851 --> 01:03:07,059
then return here
and choose a new route.

591
01:03:08,143 --> 01:03:09,143
Reasonable.

592
01:03:09,184 --> 01:03:12,142
Two of us should stay,
to protect the others.

593
01:03:12,185 --> 01:03:15,310
- Architect and I will stay.
- Architect won't be able to help you.

594
01:03:16,309 --> 01:03:18,309
He can't shoot,
has no experience.

595
01:03:18,351 --> 01:03:20,226
You better stay with Tank.

596
01:03:20,811 --> 01:03:22,811
- Or I'll stay if you like.
- No.

597
01:03:22,852 --> 01:03:24,352
Nothing will happen to him!

598
01:03:24,727 --> 01:03:26,727
We're just scouting,
but we have civilians here.

599
01:03:26,768 --> 01:03:27,975
No!

600
01:03:28,018 --> 01:03:30,851
I can do it.
It's ok.

601
01:03:32,685 --> 01:03:36,644
Tank stays here.
Architect, get to that hill.

602
01:03:36,684 --> 01:03:39,560
When you see a plane, come
back right away. Understood?

603
01:03:39,602 --> 01:03:41,101
The rest go in your
respective direction.

604
01:03:41,143 --> 01:03:42,727
Spread out!

605
01:05:14,101 --> 01:05:15,809
Tank, what are you
doing here?

606
01:05:16,602 --> 01:05:19,184
Yan sent me,
like he sensed it.

607
01:05:21,977 --> 01:05:23,017
Hurry!

608
01:05:34,726 --> 01:05:36,976
Reapers!
About a thousand feet!

609
01:05:37,018 --> 01:05:38,851
We need to leave!

610
01:05:43,142 --> 01:05:44,851
- What...
- Give me that!

611
01:05:44,892 --> 01:05:46,767
- What are you doing?
- I said give it to me!

612
01:05:48,601 --> 01:05:49,934
Let go of it!

613
01:05:51,892 --> 01:05:53,643
Let him go!

614
01:05:56,352 --> 01:05:58,227
Where did you get that?

615
01:05:58,976 --> 01:06:01,892
- You planted it!
- You set us all up!

616
01:06:06,226 --> 01:06:09,602
I didn't mean to.
We need to leave.

617
01:06:10,893 --> 01:06:12,602
Hey! Wait!

618
01:06:14,017 --> 01:06:15,725
It's not what you think.

619
01:06:15,767 --> 01:06:19,101
You don't know everything.

620
01:06:19,143 --> 01:06:21,269
It's... He's the one who...

621
01:06:31,851 --> 01:06:35,725
We need to leave.
We all need to leave right now.

622
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:37,726
Reapers!

623
01:06:39,810 --> 01:06:42,060
Astronomer!
Lead everyone away!

624
01:06:43,352 --> 01:06:47,269
Listen up everyone!
Get rid of the heavy gear!

625
01:06:52,142 --> 01:06:52,976
Cable!

626
01:06:57,309 --> 01:06:58,767
On your right!

627
01:07:19,226 --> 01:07:20,309
Architect, to the bus!
Hurry!

628
01:07:20,352 --> 01:07:22,226
Astronomer,
take him with you!

629
01:08:06,725 --> 01:08:07,977
Hey.

630
01:08:10,226 --> 01:08:11,977
Hey!

631
01:08:12,352 --> 01:08:14,144
Hey!

632
01:08:14,893 --> 01:08:16,352
Hey!

633
01:08:29,184 --> 01:08:31,851
- They responded to the Reaper whistle.
- Behind you!

634
01:08:32,893 --> 01:08:34,601
This is it, guys.

635
01:08:35,352 --> 01:08:36,935
There!

636
01:08:46,269 --> 01:08:48,018
Architect!

637
01:10:14,393 --> 01:10:16,226
We're almost there.

638
01:10:16,269 --> 01:10:18,685
- Were you given an advance payment?
- What advance payment?

639
01:10:18,726 --> 01:10:19,726
Don't you see?

640
01:10:19,768 --> 01:10:22,059
Unlike other idiots,
they accepted me

641
01:10:22,102 --> 01:10:23,560
and my projects!

642
01:10:23,601 --> 01:10:26,102
Yeah, right.
They told you how cool you are,

643
01:10:26,143 --> 01:10:27,767
how great your projects
are and that's it?

644
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:28,935
Have you lost your mind?

645
01:10:28,976 --> 01:10:30,268
Do you watch TV?

646
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:32,684
Do you have any idea what
they say about your clients?

647
01:10:32,726 --> 01:10:36,143
They are using you.
They won't pay you.

648
01:10:36,185 --> 01:10:38,226
Or even worse,
I don't know.

649
01:10:38,269 --> 01:10:41,060
There is a way out.

650
01:10:42,185 --> 01:10:44,852
The Teacher loves you.

651
01:10:45,102 --> 01:10:46,935
Save us!

652
01:10:47,934 --> 01:10:49,600
Follow his calling.

653
01:10:49,642 --> 01:10:52,184
- Read what the Teacher says about you!
- Damn!

654
01:10:52,226 --> 01:10:54,393
A path to a new life
will open up for you!

655
01:10:55,144 --> 01:10:56,977
A new life awaits.

656
01:10:57,018 --> 01:11:00,101
Read what the Teacher
says about you.

657
01:11:02,102 --> 01:11:03,810
He will set you free.

658
01:11:05,185 --> 01:11:07,144
- Is that him?
- I don't know.

659
01:11:07,685 --> 01:11:08,601
You don't know
what he looks like?

660
01:11:08,642 --> 01:11:10,310
We just talked online,
that's it.

661
01:11:10,352 --> 01:11:11,642
Zip it!

662
01:11:13,351 --> 01:11:15,310
We were told
you'd be alone.

663
01:11:15,352 --> 01:11:17,935
- But he's not alone!
- Calm down.

664
01:11:17,976 --> 01:11:20,184
We can only let
you in alone.

665
01:11:20,227 --> 01:11:22,185
My apologies,
we have very strict rules.

666
01:11:22,726 --> 01:11:25,726
- Are you the client?
- Oh no, of course not.

667
01:11:25,767 --> 01:11:28,227
I'm just a simple assistant.

668
01:11:29,726 --> 01:11:32,143
It was me who sent
you the proposal mail.

669
01:11:32,393 --> 01:11:34,768
The Teacher is
awaiting you inside.

670
01:11:35,643 --> 01:11:39,018
- You aren't going to...
- I beg you, please wait for me here.

671
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:40,685
- Hold on.
- What?

672
01:11:40,726 --> 01:11:42,352
Here, take it.

673
01:11:52,311 --> 01:11:54,727
What is it?
A hospital?

674
01:11:54,768 --> 01:11:57,810
Used to be.
We just took it over.

675
01:12:29,684 --> 01:12:32,642
Genius. How long have
you had this idea?

676
01:12:32,685 --> 01:12:34,643
Since university.

677
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:37,894
And people continue
building these ugly boxes.

678
01:12:37,935 --> 01:12:40,102
Yes, you're absolutely right,
it's crazy.

679
01:12:40,143 --> 01:12:42,934
I've sent them to many places.
To different competitions etc...

680
01:12:42,976 --> 01:12:46,101
Pointless. It's pointless
to cast pearls before swine.

681
01:12:46,143 --> 01:12:49,935
This world will never
recognize something unique,

682
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:53,144
even if it's 100 times better.

683
01:12:53,392 --> 01:12:56,350
Would you really be able
to build what I propose?

684
01:12:58,685 --> 01:13:00,643
Follow me,
I'll show you something.

685
01:13:08,976 --> 01:13:13,767
Pardon me, what exactly
does your organization do?

686
01:13:15,227 --> 01:13:18,144
You know,
there are many rumors.

687
01:13:19,643 --> 01:13:21,602
We give people an
enlightened new life.

688
01:13:21,642 --> 01:13:23,309
You can see it on the billboard.

689
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:28,144
You'll see it for yourself.

690
01:13:38,767 --> 01:13:40,851
While studying the cerebral
physiology of the brain,

691
01:13:40,894 --> 01:13:43,602
I discovered that in a state
of a deep coma,

692
01:13:43,642 --> 01:13:47,143
one has access to a whole world
that no one else knows about.

693
01:13:47,186 --> 01:13:50,977
This world is much better
than the common reality.

694
01:13:51,727 --> 01:13:53,351
Do you mean dreams?

695
01:13:53,851 --> 01:13:56,143
It's impossible to explain.
Would you like to take a look?

696
01:13:56,186 --> 01:13:58,350
I'm in a hurry,
I've got things to do.

697
01:13:58,393 --> 01:14:00,351
It won't take long.

698
01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:03,101
I'm sure you'll like it!

699
01:14:05,768 --> 01:14:07,726
Get off!
Stay away!

700
01:14:23,310 --> 01:14:25,810
- What happened?
- Come on! Go! Go! Go!

701
01:14:27,768 --> 01:14:29,643
I just ran a person over!

702
01:14:29,685 --> 01:14:32,226
- Drive! Drive! Drive!
- I told you they were lying!

703
01:14:32,267 --> 01:14:35,225
Why don't you listen to me!
Why can't you ever listen to me!

704
01:15:13,685 --> 01:15:18,810
She was put in a coma just
a couple of hours before you.

705
01:15:19,268 --> 01:15:21,643
But there,
months have passed.

706
01:15:21,685 --> 01:15:23,350
Extraordinary, isn't it?

707
01:15:23,851 --> 01:15:25,809
Who the hell are you?

708
01:15:26,392 --> 01:15:31,060
A group of scientists who want
to gift people a new world.

709
01:15:32,019 --> 01:15:34,184
And the spiritual teachings?

710
01:15:34,684 --> 01:15:37,268
To help to finance
the project.

711
01:15:37,309 --> 01:15:41,309
My studies were deemed a
failure, so I had to find a way.

712
01:15:41,351 --> 01:15:42,977
As a wise man said,

713
01:15:43,018 --> 01:15:46,852
"If you want to get rich,
create your own religion."

714
01:15:46,894 --> 01:15:50,977
You know, by the way, it was
much easier than I thought.

715
01:15:51,019 --> 01:15:54,643
- So my city project is a lie?
- Of course not!

716
01:15:55,934 --> 01:15:57,642
The city is real.

717
01:15:58,185 --> 01:16:01,643
I've formed a team of people

718
01:16:01,685 --> 01:16:04,643
with specific brain pathologies,

719
01:16:04,684 --> 01:16:06,810
so they could survive
in a coma.

720
01:16:06,851 --> 01:16:10,810
I found an artist with an
amazing memory and imagination,

721
01:16:10,852 --> 01:16:15,185
so he could work on a worthy
project and realize it there.

722
01:16:15,226 --> 01:16:16,685
What for?

723
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:20,018
Don't you get it?
To live there.

724
01:16:20,267 --> 01:16:21,934
In dreams?

725
01:16:23,352 --> 01:16:27,019
The coma world was known
to people long before us.

726
01:16:27,727 --> 01:16:32,643
Ancient rulers of many
cultures went there.

727
01:16:32,684 --> 01:16:34,810
But modern technology
plastered it

728
01:16:34,851 --> 01:16:38,726
with walking corpses
of Reapers.

729
01:16:38,769 --> 01:16:41,727
And all these people found a
new meaning there, a new life.

730
01:16:41,768 --> 01:16:44,019
Even you were
almost happy there.

731
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:46,310
There, you are
the great architect.

732
01:16:46,351 --> 01:16:48,643
And what awaits you here?

733
01:16:48,934 --> 01:16:51,018
Custom cottages.

734
01:16:51,392 --> 01:16:53,643
If you're lucky.

735
01:16:54,936 --> 01:16:57,185
Did they get the
same injection as me?

736
01:16:57,225 --> 01:16:59,351
It's faster
and better for them.

737
01:16:59,392 --> 01:17:01,393
Maybe you should have
asked them first!

738
01:17:04,351 --> 01:17:07,643
You know, Phantom's memory
was fully recovered.

739
01:17:08,226 --> 01:17:10,685
He remembered
how he got here

740
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:12,977
and who he was.

741
01:17:14,225 --> 01:17:16,976
But he didn't want
to wake up.

742
01:17:17,018 --> 01:17:19,019
Later a Reaper got to him.

743
01:17:19,060 --> 01:17:22,268
On a physiological level
it's a necrosis of brain tissue.

744
01:17:22,851 --> 01:17:24,018
He panicked,

745
01:17:24,059 --> 01:17:26,685
started to threaten us that
he would reveal the truth.

746
01:17:26,727 --> 01:17:27,936
In the end he killed
a bunch of people

747
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:29,352
and almost screwed up
everything.

748
01:17:29,393 --> 01:17:31,894
It took some effort
to get you out of there.

749
01:17:32,310 --> 01:17:35,852
So the more you know, really,
the more problems arise.

750
01:17:38,227 --> 01:17:40,310
And... all of your followers,

751
01:17:40,351 --> 01:17:42,352
will you take them
with you to Coma?

752
01:17:42,393 --> 01:17:44,185
We need them to
create a mode of life.

753
01:17:44,226 --> 01:17:45,935
Slaves.

754
01:17:45,976 --> 01:17:49,644
But they don't know that they
will be put into a coma, right?

755
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:53,100
In return I give people an
infinite life full of meaning.

756
01:17:53,142 --> 01:17:54,267
What's wrong with that?

757
01:17:54,310 --> 01:17:56,727
Everyone gets what
they want in Coma.

758
01:17:56,768 --> 01:17:59,851
One person is a commander
or spiritual leader,

759
01:17:59,894 --> 01:18:02,352
another person
is a great architect.

760
01:18:02,392 --> 01:18:04,184
You are crazy!

761
01:18:04,226 --> 01:18:05,936
Don't you understand
these are just dreams?

762
01:18:05,977 --> 01:18:07,852
It doesn't matter.
Look...

763
01:18:07,894 --> 01:18:08,810
That's it,
I'm out of here.

764
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:11,351
Just let us go, please,
that's all.

765
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:17,894
Knowledge is the source
of all problems.

766
01:18:21,685 --> 01:18:24,185
You will still accomplish
what is required.

767
01:18:24,227 --> 01:18:26,727
I won't go back
there anymore.

768
01:18:29,226 --> 01:18:32,267
You know,
when a Reaper gets a person,

769
01:18:33,017 --> 01:18:36,893
their brain dies
in a couple of minutes.

770
01:18:37,142 --> 01:18:39,143
Did you leave her
in a field?

771
01:18:39,185 --> 01:18:41,352
Hmm, strange.
For now...

772
01:18:41,393 --> 01:18:42,685
For now it seems normal.

773
01:18:42,727 --> 01:18:44,685
But it's impossible to see
everything--

774
01:18:44,726 --> 01:18:46,101
Enough!

775
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:49,060
Let her go!
She's not a part of this!

776
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:50,017
I invited you alone.

777
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:52,185
You started the race
and crashed.

778
01:18:52,226 --> 01:18:55,185
You did this to yourself,
and to her.

779
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:58,810
Either way, you're building the
island and your city on it.

780
01:18:58,852 --> 01:19:00,976
Then I will let you both go.

781
01:19:01,017 --> 01:19:03,059
You will let all of us go!

782
01:19:06,268 --> 01:19:09,727
I give you my word,
I won't hold anyone back.

783
01:19:29,934 --> 01:19:32,226
You will wake up
in your home again.

784
01:19:33,059 --> 01:19:36,726
The brain is drawn to
the strongest memories.

785
01:19:37,975 --> 01:19:40,726
This time, your memory
will recover much faster.

786
01:19:41,017 --> 01:19:43,018
You will find Astronomer.

787
01:19:43,059 --> 01:19:45,560
The coordinates for building
the city are on his map.

788
01:19:45,601 --> 01:19:47,352
What if I don't make it?

789
01:19:47,393 --> 01:19:49,227
You will.

790
01:19:49,267 --> 01:19:53,934
This stimulant will make
your brain work more intensely.

791
01:19:54,851 --> 01:19:56,643
Sure, it will
damage your health,

792
01:19:57,227 --> 01:19:59,685
but you'll be like
Superman for a while.

793
01:20:00,059 --> 01:20:03,392
Wait, how will they know when
it's time to get out of Coma?

794
01:20:03,685 --> 01:20:04,975
They won't.

795
01:20:05,934 --> 01:20:09,226
Well, there is a way.
From within.

796
01:20:09,893 --> 01:20:11,893
A back door of sorts.

797
01:20:11,935 --> 01:20:14,685
I'll show you once you've
accomplished everything.

798
01:20:14,727 --> 01:20:17,726
Think about it.
I was able to leave.

799
01:20:18,352 --> 01:20:19,935
Sleep.

800
01:21:39,309 --> 01:21:40,850
Get down!

801
01:21:48,727 --> 01:21:51,726
That's it.
That's the last one.

802
01:21:51,768 --> 01:21:53,851
Leave it with us.

803
01:22:20,102 --> 01:22:21,892
Yeah...

804
01:22:24,309 --> 01:22:26,601
It's not what you think.

805
01:22:29,686 --> 01:22:31,644
We need to leave.

806
01:22:31,685 --> 01:22:33,268
Hurry.

807
01:22:43,268 --> 01:22:45,725
A lot of people resist it
in the beginning.

808
01:22:45,768 --> 01:22:48,060
Maybe you should
give him some more time.

809
01:22:49,977 --> 01:22:51,643
No.

810
01:22:53,017 --> 01:22:55,018
Do as I say.

811
01:23:14,352 --> 01:23:16,227
Here it is.

812
01:23:17,102 --> 01:23:19,310
Yan chose this place himself.

813
01:23:19,351 --> 01:23:23,226
He said it was majestic.

814
01:23:26,102 --> 01:23:27,602
What's wrong?

815
01:23:27,643 --> 01:23:29,226
Are you hurt?

816
01:23:29,269 --> 01:23:32,393
It's nothing.
I'm just tired.

817
01:23:34,143 --> 01:23:36,602
I will live on this island
for some time.

818
01:23:37,142 --> 01:23:39,102
Soon...

819
01:23:40,602 --> 01:23:42,269
I can't believe it.

820
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:45,309
Yan was right after all.

821
01:23:45,352 --> 01:23:47,018
Don't you get it?

822
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:49,977
We are all laying
in that lunatic's basement.

823
01:23:50,017 --> 01:23:52,934
There will be no island!
It's just a dream!

824
01:23:55,601 --> 01:23:57,560
I know it's hard
to comprehend,

825
01:23:57,602 --> 01:23:58,810
but when you see it
with your own eyes,

826
01:23:58,851 --> 01:24:00,809
how you're laying there...

827
01:24:00,851 --> 01:24:03,184
So you told them after all.

828
01:24:03,935 --> 01:24:05,852
They've been through
so much already.

829
01:24:05,893 --> 01:24:08,018
It's not very fair.

830
01:24:09,269 --> 01:24:11,102
Where do you want it?

831
01:24:12,767 --> 01:24:16,102
The bridge should
start right here.

832
01:25:26,226 --> 01:25:28,726
"God saw all
that he had made,

833
01:25:28,767 --> 01:25:31,018
and it was very good."

834
01:26:30,642 --> 01:26:33,184
What do you need reality
for after this?

835
01:26:38,227 --> 01:26:40,810
Yan, I've built everything.
Let us go.

836
01:26:48,309 --> 01:26:49,935
Spirit.

837
01:26:50,893 --> 01:26:54,310
In life you saw dead people
all around you...

838
01:26:55,269 --> 01:26:58,352
...and had seizures
a couple of times a day.

839
01:26:58,810 --> 01:27:02,310
You don't have any relatives,
and you lost your only child.

840
01:27:02,810 --> 01:27:04,226
I saved you from the asylum,

841
01:27:04,269 --> 01:27:07,893
where you would have rotted
till your dying day.

842
01:27:08,310 --> 01:27:10,102
Tank.

843
01:27:10,143 --> 01:27:12,893
You lost your family
in an accident.

844
01:27:13,684 --> 01:27:15,226
Became a raging alcoholic.

845
01:27:15,268 --> 01:27:17,768
Started shooting
at your neighbors.

846
01:27:17,809 --> 01:27:22,726
You would have ended up
in a madhouse or a jail.

847
01:27:23,727 --> 01:27:26,060
Astronomer, you're autistic.

848
01:27:26,101 --> 01:27:28,143
You can't even leave
your house.

849
01:27:28,184 --> 01:27:31,310
Your poor old folks.

850
01:27:31,684 --> 01:27:34,643
What will happen
when they die, huh?

851
01:27:35,727 --> 01:27:39,768
And you have a more serious
issue, Architect.

852
01:27:41,311 --> 01:27:44,977
Your ideas are beautiful,
but way ahead of their time,

853
01:27:45,018 --> 01:27:46,184
so no one wants them.

854
01:27:46,227 --> 01:27:48,643
Everyone has abandoned you,
including her,

855
01:27:48,684 --> 01:27:50,143
who was by your side
till the very end.

856
01:27:50,184 --> 01:27:52,226
He is nothing out there.

857
01:27:53,101 --> 01:27:54,934
An infantile,
unrecognized genius

858
01:27:54,977 --> 01:27:57,768
who lets all his anger
out on you,

859
01:27:57,809 --> 01:27:59,976
on the whole world.

860
01:28:01,684 --> 01:28:06,143
I bet you contemplated suicide
long before you got that email.

861
01:28:09,185 --> 01:28:13,227
This project gave
new meaning to your life.

862
01:28:20,101 --> 01:28:22,601
- Were you given an advance payment?
- What advance?

863
01:28:22,642 --> 01:28:23,976
Don't you see?

864
01:28:24,019 --> 01:28:25,977
Unlike other idiots,
they accepted me

865
01:28:26,018 --> 01:28:27,809
and my projects!

866
01:28:28,893 --> 01:28:30,144
Keep laughing.

867
01:28:30,184 --> 01:28:31,976
Everything will change for us
after this, I know it.

868
01:28:32,019 --> 01:28:35,602
For us?
There is no "us".

869
01:28:35,642 --> 01:28:37,602
That's why you're
sitting in this car.

870
01:28:37,643 --> 01:28:38,809
Jesus!

871
01:28:39,977 --> 01:28:41,643
They told you
how cool you are,

872
01:28:41,685 --> 01:28:43,977
how great your projects are,
and that's it?

873
01:28:44,018 --> 01:28:47,227
- Have you lost your mind?
- You used to believe in me.

874
01:28:47,269 --> 01:28:50,768
They are using you,
they won't pay you.

875
01:28:50,809 --> 01:28:54,310
- Or even worse, I don't know.
- Got a guilty conscience?

876
01:28:54,767 --> 01:28:57,311
This is a great car.
I'm sure it was a gift,

877
01:28:57,351 --> 01:29:00,810
considering you're just a nurse.
But that's ok.

878
01:29:00,852 --> 01:29:03,851
I'll buy you a new one
when I'm famous.

879
01:29:05,684 --> 01:29:07,851
This is the last time
I'm helping you.

880
01:29:13,894 --> 01:29:15,977
We're staying.

881
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:18,350
Stay.

882
01:29:28,351 --> 01:29:31,852
But now
I won't let you stay.

883
01:29:37,767 --> 01:29:40,392
I can't.
You would reveal everything.

884
01:29:44,768 --> 01:29:47,935
- And who's going to believe us?
- My followers.

885
01:29:47,976 --> 01:29:50,976
You can't hide it forever.
And in heaven,

886
01:29:51,018 --> 01:29:55,143
there is no place for those who
know the secret of its creation.

887
01:29:55,810 --> 01:29:57,768
It concerns you as well.

888
01:29:57,809 --> 01:29:59,726
Now that you know everything,

889
01:29:59,767 --> 01:30:01,851
I can't let you live
among the others.

890
01:30:01,894 --> 01:30:04,186
We won't tell anyone.

891
01:30:05,851 --> 01:30:07,642
It's done.

892
01:30:12,643 --> 01:30:14,144
You are suffocating there.

893
01:30:14,186 --> 01:30:17,894
Brain oxygen
starvation has started

894
01:30:18,227 --> 01:30:20,810
and you will feel it soon.

895
01:30:27,351 --> 01:30:30,144
I don't know in which order
you were switched off.

896
01:30:30,185 --> 01:30:31,059
There, it's a matter
of seconds,

897
01:30:31,102 --> 01:30:33,976
but here we've got
about fifteen minutes

898
01:30:34,019 --> 01:30:35,852
to say our goodbyes.

899
01:30:41,101 --> 01:30:41,809
Stop!

900
01:30:47,852 --> 01:30:50,018
I was prepared for this.

901
01:30:50,060 --> 01:30:51,852
Brain stimulation
can be harmful,

902
01:30:51,894 --> 01:30:54,935
but I thought it wouldn't
hurt in this situation.

903
01:30:55,976 --> 01:30:57,977
I have business to attend to.

904
01:31:20,851 --> 01:31:22,768
Damn it!

905
01:31:22,809 --> 01:31:25,185
You warned me that
they would fuck me over.

906
01:31:26,061 --> 01:31:28,185
- What?
- We need to wake up.

907
01:31:29,935 --> 01:31:32,184
We will wake up
and switch him off.

908
01:31:32,225 --> 01:31:33,768
The back door!

909
01:31:34,102 --> 01:31:35,393
Astronomer!

910
01:31:37,267 --> 01:31:39,726
How did he escape
when the Reapers attacked?

911
01:31:39,769 --> 01:31:41,101
Dreams.

912
01:31:41,144 --> 01:31:44,185
All of us are dreaming
where we are laying right now.

913
01:31:44,225 --> 01:31:46,351
If you can find yourself
in that dream, then...

914
01:31:46,392 --> 01:31:49,684
That's why he said that
dreams are dangerous!

915
01:31:49,727 --> 01:31:51,061
- They are dangerous.
- Let's go!

916
01:31:51,102 --> 01:31:53,185
- It's not that easy!
- We don't have much time, Astronomer!

917
01:31:53,225 --> 01:31:54,684
Spirit, let's go!

918
01:32:50,935 --> 01:32:52,019
Come on.

919
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:54,018
Astronomer, we need
to get to Yan's room. Hurry!

920
01:32:55,351 --> 01:32:57,060
They are already there.

921
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:06,893
- We won't make it!
- Shit!

922
01:33:11,226 --> 01:33:12,769
I've got an idea.

923
01:33:29,142 --> 01:33:30,769
Come on!
Hurry!

924
01:34:53,352 --> 01:34:56,685
- What?
- It's not how I remember it.

925
01:34:56,726 --> 01:34:59,142
These are dreams,
I told you.

926
01:34:59,936 --> 01:35:01,268
We need to try harder
to find that place.

927
01:35:01,309 --> 01:35:03,100
Everything is mixed up here.

928
01:35:04,935 --> 01:35:06,809
Then there, I think.

929
01:36:13,227 --> 01:36:16,726
There was a door and stairs.
It's not the same!

930
01:36:17,976 --> 01:36:19,142
Astronomer?

931
01:36:19,768 --> 01:36:22,309
Everything is linked
by association in here.

932
01:36:22,810 --> 01:36:25,185
Try not to search according
to the blueprint of the rooms.

933
01:36:26,268 --> 01:36:27,644
How?

934
01:36:28,185 --> 01:36:29,769
Details!

935
01:36:29,810 --> 01:36:33,267
Search for a detail that
reminds you of that room.

936
01:36:33,851 --> 01:36:35,227
A detail...

937
01:36:53,684 --> 01:36:55,267
Yes, here it is.

938
01:36:56,185 --> 01:36:59,143
It was in a painting
in that room!

939
01:36:59,393 --> 01:37:00,893
Right.

940
01:37:01,810 --> 01:37:03,351
I was right.

941
01:37:09,226 --> 01:37:11,142
Of course you're right.

942
01:37:12,684 --> 01:37:14,226
Astronomer is a genius
after all.

943
01:37:14,267 --> 01:37:16,102
Where would we be
without him?

944
01:37:16,143 --> 01:37:19,394
Our memory retains the things
we find most interesting.

945
01:37:20,143 --> 01:37:20,934
And of all things,

946
01:37:20,976 --> 01:37:23,769
you remembered a temple
in a painting.

947
01:37:25,102 --> 01:37:26,935
A true architect.

948
01:37:28,184 --> 01:37:31,769
You know, I really hoped
you'd be smarter than the rest.

949
01:37:33,143 --> 01:37:35,851
You reminded me of myself
when I was young.

950
01:37:39,643 --> 01:37:41,309
Medicine fights to prolong
a human's life

951
01:37:41,351 --> 01:37:42,768
for five more years.

952
01:37:43,268 --> 01:37:45,686
But I was able to
prolong it for a thousand.

953
01:37:45,726 --> 01:37:47,267
And you know what?

954
01:37:47,602 --> 01:37:49,727
My department was closed,

955
01:37:49,769 --> 01:37:54,017
to finance the development
of a new anti-cellulite product.

956
01:37:54,934 --> 01:37:57,934
And I never understood how to
live in a world so foolish,

957
01:37:57,976 --> 01:37:58,935
so ugly.

958
01:37:58,975 --> 01:38:02,267
But then I realized
there is another world.

959
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:04,352
I discovered it.

960
01:38:10,309 --> 01:38:11,768
Fly, run!

961
01:38:15,102 --> 01:38:17,102
But just like you,
I had my doubts.

962
01:38:17,143 --> 01:38:19,309
It's just an illusion
after all.

963
01:38:19,935 --> 01:38:22,394
I thought so,
until I made a discovery.

964
01:38:23,268 --> 01:38:26,602
Everything that we live for,
all of our emotions--

965
01:38:26,644 --> 01:38:30,977
joy, happiness, anger,
astonishment, sadness--

966
01:38:31,018 --> 01:38:34,602
they are all simply
electrical signals of our brain.

967
01:38:35,850 --> 01:38:37,935
We measured them on people
in a coma and in real life,

968
01:38:37,976 --> 01:38:39,977
and you know what?

969
01:38:40,018 --> 01:38:42,767
They are absolutely identical.

970
01:38:43,934 --> 01:38:46,934
Life in Coma
is as real as it gets.

971
01:38:49,685 --> 01:38:52,017
That's it.
It's as simple as that.

972
01:40:51,726 --> 01:40:53,768
We found it, Fly.

973
01:42:00,226 --> 01:42:01,352
Come on.

974
01:42:02,017 --> 01:42:03,309
Come on.

975
01:42:03,351 --> 01:42:04,851
Quiet.

976
01:42:08,976 --> 01:42:10,852
Quiet.

977
01:42:11,685 --> 01:42:14,684
Breath.
Breath.

978
01:42:15,685 --> 01:42:18,768
Breath. Quiet.

979
01:42:40,394 --> 01:42:41,809
What...

980
01:43:01,726 --> 01:43:03,309
We're going home.

981
01:43:03,351 --> 01:43:04,810
Everything is going
to be alright.

982
01:43:04,852 --> 01:43:06,852
We're going home.

983
01:43:07,101 --> 01:43:09,726
We're going.
Stand up.

984
01:44:19,144 --> 01:44:22,810
Well, I'm almost done,
but I need a break.

985
01:44:22,851 --> 01:44:26,810
- Let's take Torik out for a walk.
- Alright, let's go.

986
01:44:26,851 --> 01:44:30,143
What about your projects?
Did anyone reply?

987
01:44:30,185 --> 01:44:31,394
No.

988
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:35,185
Maybe that's down
to the presentation.

989
01:44:35,226 --> 01:44:38,184
No, everything is fine.
You just have to be realistic.

990
01:44:38,227 --> 01:44:39,977
My projects are worthless.

991
01:44:40,019 --> 01:44:43,810
But at least this year
will be better financially.

992
01:44:43,851 --> 01:44:45,727
We won the contract.

993
01:44:46,059 --> 01:44:48,101
- Are you kidding?
- No.

994
01:44:49,643 --> 01:44:51,184
Congratulations.

995
01:44:51,227 --> 01:44:53,060
It looks like
the scandal involving

996
01:44:53,101 --> 01:44:54,310
the Foundation
of Eternal Life

997
01:44:54,351 --> 01:44:56,352
will end without a result,
after all.

998
01:44:56,685 --> 01:45:01,018
All charges will be dropped
due to a lack of evidence,

999
01:45:01,060 --> 01:45:05,352
as it was established that
all subjects of the experiment

1000
01:45:05,392 --> 01:45:07,019
were there legally.

1001
01:45:07,060 --> 01:45:09,977
The organization continues
to successfully

1002
01:45:10,018 --> 01:45:11,393
recruit followers...

1003
01:45:23,976 --> 01:45:26,018
Do you think they
will come for us?

1004
01:45:26,059 --> 01:45:27,184
We have nothing
to be afraid of.

1005
01:45:27,227 --> 01:45:28,642
Get dressed.

1006
01:45:43,934 --> 01:45:45,726
By the way,
the mail came this morning.

1007
01:45:45,767 --> 01:45:47,101
There was an envelope
for you.

1008
01:45:47,144 --> 01:45:49,059
- Yeah, I saw it already.
- What was in it?

1009
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:55,935
Nothing special.

1010
01:45:55,976 --> 01:45:59,018
Just some documents
for an old project.

1011
