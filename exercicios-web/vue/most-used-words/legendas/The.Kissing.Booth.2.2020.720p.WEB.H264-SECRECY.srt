1
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:27,416
{\an8}<i>Considering where we left off,</i>

2
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:30,208
{\an8}<i>I'm guessing
you might have a few questions.</i>

3
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,208
{\an8}<i>Well, from the moment I told Noah...</i>

4
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:33,416
{\an8}I love you.

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,833
{\an8}<i>...till the moment when he finally left,</i>

6
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:37,666
{\an8}<i>a whole lot of stuff happened.</i>

7
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,208
<i>Let me bring you up to speed...</i>

8
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:42,250
{\an8}<i>As soon as school ended,
the Flynns opened up their beach house.</i>

9
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,000
{\an8}<i>Noah and I spent the whole summer there.</i>

10
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,000
{\an8}Oh, my gosh!

11
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:46,416
{\an8}<i> Got an awesome gift...</i>

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,750
{\an8}<i>Played board games
till three in the morning.</i>

13
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,833
{\an8}<i>Made sparks fly. This time on the beach.</i>

14
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:54,000
{\an8}<i>Said hi to an old friend,
watched a gorgeous sunset...</i>

15
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,875
{\an8}<i>...watched Noah sleep,</i>

16
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:00,375
{\an8}<i>watched Noah try to rollerblade,</i>

17
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,458
{\an8}<i>watched the sun come up
in my favorite way,</i>

18
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:04,458
<i>and then, just like that,</i>

19
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:08,083
<i>exactly 27 days ago, my heart flew away.</i>

20
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:11,250
{\an8}<i>After Noah left, it was hard.</i>

21
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:14,000
{\an8}<i>He said he wanted
to make long-distance work,</i>

22
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:18,083
{\an8}<i>but I decided to be a grown-up
about things and to give Noah his space.</i>

23
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:21,958
<i>I guess that's the kind of maturity
that comes from being a senior.</i>

24
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:24,000
<i>In other words, I was okay.</i>

25
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:27,125
{\an8}<i>Meanwhile, I did everything I could
to keep my mind off the fact</i>

26
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,458
{\an8}<i>That Noah was 3,000 miles away.</i>

27
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:31,958
<i>Like I started working
on my college essay,</i>

28
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:34,125
{\an8}<i>started a podcast
about video games with Lee.</i>

29
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,333
{\an8}- <i>Game On!</i>
<i>- Already got subscribers,</i>

30
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:38,000
{\an8}<i>- thank you very much.</i>
- Foreign Danger!

31
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:40,333
{\an8}<i>And finally dominated
my nemesis on Xbox...</i>

32
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:43,666
<i>Watched Ultimate Frisbee
at the beach house,</i>

33
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,625
{\an8}<i>watched '80s movies with Lee and Rachel,</i>

34
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,916
{\an8}<i>watched Lee fall completely in love,</i>

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,666
{\an8}<i>-watched Lee get a super buff bod,</i>
-Ooh!

36
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,541
{\an8}<i>Watched girls watching
Lee's super buff bod,</i>

37
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:55,791
{\an8}<i>applied for a passport,
applied for a credit card,</i>

38
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,541
{\an8}<i>even applied with Lee
to our dream college.</i>

39
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:02,625
<i>Rule number 19: always go
to the same school as your bestie.</i>

40
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,875
{\an8}<i>And for us, when it comes to college,</i>

41
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,583
{\an8}<i>that means
the University of California at Berkeley.</i>

42
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:10,041
{\an8}<i>UC Berkeley is this totally dope,</i>

43
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:12,375
{\an8}<i>completely amazing school
in Northern California.</i>

44
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,333
{\an8}<i>Lee and I have dreamed of going there</i>

45
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:17,000
{\an8}<i>ever since we found out
that's where our moms became besties.</i>

46
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,500
{\an8}<i>It has a really cool tower,
hill rolling for good luck,</i>

47
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:22,166
{\an8}<i>famous Insta squirrels,
and a cool meme page.</i>

48
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:24,583
<i>This one's for you, Mom.</i>

49
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,166
{\an8}<i>Took Brad to the arcade,
took Lee and Rachel hiking,</i>

50
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,208
{\an8}<i>took a naughty photo for Noah,</i>

51
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,791
{\an8}<i>chickened out about sending it though.</i>

52
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:39,166
<i>And the last thing I took was
one final moment all to myself.</i>

53
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:42,583
{\an8}<i>By the end of the summer,</i>

54
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,166
{\an8}<i>I was feeling pretty sorted out
about things with Noah.</i>

55
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:49,541
<i>He was where he was supposed to be,
and I was where I was supposed to be.</i>

56
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,500
<i>And if it works out for us, great!</i>

57
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:55,083
<i>But if not, that would be okay too.</i>

58
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:01,416
<i>Like I said, I was okay...</i>

59
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:04,666
<i>mostly.</i>

60
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,666
{\an8}<i>And here I am
getting ready for my first day of school,</i>

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
<i>and everything seems... different somehow.</i>

62
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:41,833
There she is.

63
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,333
Last first day! I gotta go.

64
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,416
Mmm! Love you. Love you.

65
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,375
- Love you more.
- All right, I'm gonna...

66
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,000
What up?

67
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,541
What up?

68
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,708
Oh, what is this?

69
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:58,916
Open it.

70
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,125
Okay!

71
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:05,833
Very funny.

72
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:06,916
Oh, what can I say?

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,708
I thought you might need a pair
of those back-up back-ups this time.

74
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,625
Hey!

75
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,541
You should try those on, though.
I think they would look quite slimming.

76
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,500
Hey, uh... where are you...
Where are you going? School's that way.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Going to get Rachel.

78
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,833
Oh. Gotcha.

79
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:32,791
What's up, foxy lady?

80
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,083
Yeah, right. As if.

81
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:40,958
Oh, okay.

82
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,916
Let's do it, y'all.

83
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:46,250
What?

84
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:49,291
I'm just thinking
about how insanely lucky I am.

85
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,541
All right, lovebirds.

86
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:57,833
Let's go! Senior year!

87
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,291
Hey!

88
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:37,541
- What is going on?
- I have no idea...

89
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:41,041
<i>I had been feeling pretty damn good</i>
<i>about senior year.</i>

90
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,333
<i>That is until
everybody was looking at me</i>

91
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,375
<i>Like my dog just died.</i>

92
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,458
- Hey, Elle.
- Hey, Tuppen.

93
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:48,833
Just heard about you and Noah breaking up.

94
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,750
- I was really hoping...
- No, we didn't break up.

95
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,083
I'm sorry. I thought you guys were
really great together.

96
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,500
- I just...
- That's not... We didn't... um...

97
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,291
- Was it your decision or his?
- Never mind.

98
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:01,583
<i>Ugh! Sometimes I hate high school.</i>

99
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,875
<i>Good morning and welcome back,</i>
<i>Los Angeles Country Day.</i>

100
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,166
<i>We hope you all had
the very best of summers</i>

101
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,625
and are ready
for another outstanding school year.

102
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:14,083
Any clubs wanting to present
fall fundraiser ideas to student council

103
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:18,500
- <i>must do so today at three p.m. sharp.</i>
- We forgot about the presentation

104
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:19,541
for the kissing booth!

105
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,041
- Oh, my God.
- Get busy!

106
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,500
And our quote of the day:

107
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:26,041
<i>"The best thing
to hold on to in life is each other."</i>

108
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:31,125
Beautiful words from an iconic film star,
Audrey Hepburn.

109
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:34,083
<i>Well said, Audrey. Well said.</i>

110
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,750
Have a fantastic day.

111
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,791
All right, everyone,

112
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,041
let's all take out
our summer reading material.

113
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:45,208
That was so good. I was so surprised.

114
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,416
Oh, and here we go.

115
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,833
Oh, my God, Ellen, how are you?

116
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,333
So many beautiful girls at Harvard.

117
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,791
- Experienced girls.
- And long distance is tough.

118
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,958
Totally explains why you guys aren't
posting on social anymore.

119
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:07,208
Oh, actually Noah and I decided
to keep it low-key on social,

120
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,750
so we wouldn't feel pressured by it.

121
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,416
That is so smart. Breakups are brutal.

122
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,416
So brutal.

123
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,125
We didn't break up, though.

124
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:17,375
With different zip codes,
breakups are basically automatic.

125
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,833
- Automatic.
- Oh, well. Gotta go.

126
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:22,666
I wanna take a peek at the new snack
that just transferred in.

127
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,875
Saw him in homeroom. His name's Marco,
and he is seriously luscious.

128
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,625
Ooh! I'm sorry about you and Flynn.

129
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,166
Um, okay.

130
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,250
Thanks. Bye.

131
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:51,250
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

132
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,750
Elle Evans, there's a phone call for you
in the office.

133
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,250
It's your father.

134
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,041
He said it's urgent.

135
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,083
- The phone's over there, honey.
- Okay.

136
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,708
- Gosh. I hope it's nothing too serious.
- Hello?

137
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,208
What's going on with you?

138
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,166
What? Uh...

139
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,625
What do you mean, Dad?

140
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,125
Why aren't you texting me back?

141
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,708
Well... what?

142
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,458
Um... oh, my God!

143
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:22,291
That's horrible, horrible news
about Aunt, um...

144
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,416
Rose.

145
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,250
Is everything okay?

146
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,375
- No.
- Uh...

147
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,666
- Could I please have a moment in private?
- Sure.

148
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:32,791
Just give me a second.

149
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:36,416
I'm stepping into the office
to take a second to process this.

150
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,791
Why are you pretending to be my dad?

151
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,083
It was the only way I could think
to get you on the phone.

152
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,625
Oh, that is not true.

153
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,041
No, it is true.
You barely call, and when you text,

154
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,541
you send
these weird two-word text messages

155
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,625
like, you know, "Take care," "Talk soon."

156
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,416
Are you breaking up with me?

157
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,583
What? No, no, no, no! The opposite.

158
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,416
Then what? Why?
Why are you ignoring me?

159
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,291
I... I don't know, I...

160
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,583
I guess I'm just...

161
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:17,125
I'm trying to be mature and not come off
like some clingy girlfriend.

162
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,583
Elle, I told you
that I wanted to make this work.

163
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,583
I know, but people always say that
when they leave.

164
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,500
I just wanted to give you space

165
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,041
so that you could figure out
if this is really what you want.

166
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:32,125
Space. Space. I don't...
I don't want space.

167
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,208
<i>Space is not what I want, I told you.</i>

168
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,291
I don't want space. I want you.

169
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,166
I want you around me all the time.

170
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,375
I want you with me right now, actually.

171
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,750
I just... I just want you, okay?

172
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,875
Text me, call me,

173
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,541
send me a messenger pigeon,
whatever it is, okay?

174
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,916
Whatever it is,
just don't give me space, okay?

175
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,208
Okay.

176
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:53,416
Okay.

177
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:59,875
First up are Elle Evans and Lee Flynn.

178
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,666
Hello, everyone. Um, we are excited
about this year's fundraiser

179
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,458
and the opportunity before us.

180
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:11,000
Based on the earnings from last year,
we believe that it would be beneficial...

181
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,208
Everybody in favor of Dance Club doing
a kissing booth again for the fundraiser,

182
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,291
- please signify by saying "Aye."
- Aye.

183
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,833
- Aye.
- All those against, say "Nay."

184
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,166
Nay.

185
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,875
Wait, no, I don't actually know
why I just said that.

186
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,166
Let the record show the Ayes have it.

187
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,958
The kissing booth is approved.

188
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,416
Whoo!

189
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:37,458
And now that that's settled,
what we're all actually curious about is

190
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,958
who you've selected
for the lineup of kissers this time.

191
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:44,708
Because without Flynn as a headliner
to draw in business,

192
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,958
the booth may not do so well this year.

193
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:50,208
- Uh, that's a good point.
- Last year is gonna be hard to top.

194
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,041
- We...
- So hard.

195
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,750
Quite true. Thoughts?

196
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,416
Well, actually,
the thoughts we're having...

197
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,041
Right. Right.
That's a good point. Great point.

198
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:03,500
Well, you know, we have decided to keep
this year's list a secret. Yeah.

199
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:07,416
But do not worry because I know
who a lot of you are already thinking of,

200
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,166
and the answer is yes.

201
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,666
They will be there.

202
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,250
Whoo! Thank you!

203
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,458
So, we didn't actually get anyone yet,
did we?

204
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,833
- That is correct, yes.
- Okay.

205
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,750
- <i>So how's Aunt Rose?</i>
- Oh, come on.

206
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,625
You can stop smirking now.

207
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,708
I miss you, jerk.

208
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,333
I miss you more.

209
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,333
So, you Big Man on Campus yet?

210
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,166
No, not exactly.

211
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,875
It's kinda different here.

212
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,333
What do you mean?

213
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,916
Well, uh...

214
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,291
What's wrong?

215
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,708
Nothing! No, nothing's wrong.
Just... doesn't matter.

216
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,875
Hey, it's okay to be homesick.

217
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,875
I'm... I'm fine. I'm... seriously,
I'm fine. It's just, you know...

218
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:05,583
What about you? How about you?
Have you applied to any more schools?

219
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,541
Don't even get me started on Berkeley!

220
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,958
If Lee and I both don't get in, I'm...

221
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,125
Don't tell me you've only applied
to one school, Elle.

222
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,458
I know,

223
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:18,166
but it's literally the only school
we've ever talked about going to.

224
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,208
Well...

225
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,458
you know what you could do?

226
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:26,000
- <i>My God. Is he about to ask me to...</i>
- Apply here.

227
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,083
As if I could get into Harvard.

228
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,875
Elle, there's over 30 schools
that you could apply to in Boston.

229
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,333
<i>And your point being that at least one
of them would accept my sorry ass?</i>

230
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:40,333
No! My point being
that if you don't get into Berkeley...

231
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,666
maybe you can come to school here.

232
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,166
<i>With me.</i>

233
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,666
I'd like that.

234
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,416
<i>You obviously couldn't see this,</i>
<i>but my heart just did a backflip.</i>

235
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:53,416
Um...

236
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,041
Okay, yeah, maybe I'll think about that.

237
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,833
Maybe you'll think about it.

238
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,166
<i>Okay, you can just think about it.</i>

239
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,041
<i>You know, all the books you have to read
if you go here, seriously...</i>

240
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,833
<i>I couldn't help but think</i>
<i>about rule number 19,</i>

241
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,333
<i>but here's the thing.</i>

242
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,208
<i>Who knows if I'd even get accepted
into a Boston school?</i>

243
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,625
<i>And if I didn't,</i>

244
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:18,583
<i>what would be the point in telling Lee now
and getting him upset over nothing?</i>

245
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,166
<i>Right?</i>

246
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,083
You have excellent grades,

247
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:26,000
great test scores, soccer, Dance Club.

248
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,833
And I also have a podcast
about video games.

249
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,416
Oh! So you're an influencer.

250
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:31,916
How many subscribers?

251
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,833
Thirty-seven.

252
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,000
Thirty-seven thousand!

253
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,041
- We can work with that.
- No, no, no, um...

254
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:38,916
Thirty-seven.

255
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,750
You're kidding, right?

256
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,666
Oh. Well, uh...

257
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:48,166
To get into top-tier colleges
like UC Berkeley and Harvard,

258
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,125
you really need to wow them
with your personal essay.

259
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,541
And yours is...

260
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,625
How shall I put this?

261
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:59,833
- Really? I thought I killed it.
- Hmm? What? No.

262
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,166
You didn't even wound it.

263
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,541
So, I'm redoing my personal essay.

264
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:06,916
Apparently it sucks.

265
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,458
Oh! New level!

266
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,625
Wonder if mine sucks.
I should probably look into that.

267
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,500
Don't want that keeping us out
of Berkeley.

268
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,625
Um, yeah. Definitely.

269
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,541
So, have you seen the new kid Marco yet?

270
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,791
Yeah. Devastatingly handsome.

271
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,833
Some are even saying
he's hotter than Noah.

272
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,666
- Really? What?
- Yeah.

273
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:27,666
That's crazy!

274
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,541
Oh, Lee! New level, Lee!

275
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,708
Lee? Lee! No! Lee!

276
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,958
We discussed this.
I need a regular feeding regimen

277
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,583
during my hands-free
<i>Ms. Pac-Man</i> experience.

278
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,083
What the hell is that?

279
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,750
Top score is "MVP"?

280
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:51,416
"Most Valuable Player"? Well,
somebody thinks highly of themselves.

281
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,375
I kind of always just figured
we'd be number one forever.

282
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:57,666
Look at me.

283
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:02,250
We are going to need slushies, churros
and an ass-load of quarters.

284
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:11,375
Surprise!

285
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,416
Hey, Evans. Come here.

286
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,000
What's up?

287
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,291
That new guy Marco, someone snagged
a video of him working out.

288
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:26,083
Oh, come on.

289
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,708
How hot can this guy actually be?

290
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,250
He can't be that hot.

291
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,166
<i>Hot.</i>

292
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:38,041
He's just a guy... whoa! Sweet mercy!

293
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,541
Jeez! Hello!

294
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,708
God! The OMGs were right!

295
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,291
<i>This guy is a snack indeed!</i>

296
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,708
Maybe an entrée!
Maybe he's also the dessert too!

297
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,125
Tell me more!

298
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,291
No, no, no.

299
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:55,333
Maybe he's the after-after dessert!
He's a big meal that we're having now!

300
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,041
Oh, shit! Sorry.

301
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,208
- Oh!!
- Sorry about that. Whoa! Oh!

302
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:05,333
He could bench you,
us together at the same time!

303
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:06,583
Yeah, definitely.

304
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:07,875
Whoa!

305
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,583
I'm confused. Do I need glasses?

306
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:15,125
Am I looking at a tray of ice cubes
or a six-pack?

307
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,583
<i>- Am I right? It's incredible!</i>
- Shit!

308
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:20,875
It's like his sweat produces
its own glitter!

309
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,500
<i>Hello, can we get two tickets</i>
<i>to the gun show, please?</i>

310
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,916
Because are those arms or cannons?

311
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,541
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

312
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,166
- It's not funny, everybody!
- Whoa!

313
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,375
If those abs had Instagram,

314
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,375
- one million followers all day!
- Wow!

315
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,041
I'm not really a butt person,

316
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:57,541
<i>but, like, now I understand
people who are!</i>

317
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,458
I don't know whether to lick it,
smack it, bite it...

318
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,416
- Bite it? Ugh!
- I wanna do all three of those things.

319
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,416
Oof! Oh!

320
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,583
Dude, I'm so sorry.

321
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:13,416
Just call me an earthquake,
because I am legit shook right now!

322
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,791
Whoa!

323
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,250
What is his name again?

324
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,083
Marco!

325
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:23,625
Marco! Marco! Marco! Marco!

326
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:26,208
Marco! Marco!

327
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,458
- Marco.
- Marco.

328
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,791
Lee?

329
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,833
Oh, my God!

330
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,041
Oh, that made my year.

331
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,708
You're cool.

332
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,000
Hello, Miss Evans.

333
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,708
Happy birthday!

334
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,916
Hey, look, it's the "get it" girl.

335
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,541
Baby, baby!

336
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,125
Gosh!

337
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,291
I bet everybody forgets by tomorrow.

338
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,916
Well, that doesn't matter

339
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,083
because I'm still transferring
to a school on the moon.

340
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,625
Is he really that good-looking?

341
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,833
I'm sorry. Was my description
not vivid enough?

342
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:17,000
I literally described
a hundred different ways Marco can get it!

343
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:23,541
Awesome.

344
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,541
I take it you're the one
from the intercom?

345
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,166
Mm-hmm, yeah.

346
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:34,416
But they're, you know, already calling me
the Get it Girl, but I go by Elle.

347
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,541
I don't know.
Get it Girl has a nice ring to it.

348
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,291
Cool.

349
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,125
So is that, like, your thing?

350
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:45,375
Carry around a guitar and remind girls
of horrible moments in their life?

351
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,916
I... I didn't mean it like that.

352
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,750
To be honest, everyone was yelling
and cheering so loud, I could barely hear

353
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,291
- what you were saying.
- That is great news.

354
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,416
Don't be embarrassed.

355
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,166
Embarrassed?

356
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,458
I... I am not embarrassed.
Get a load of this guy!

357
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,125
I am not embarrassed. No, no, no. I...

358
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,083
<i>You </i>should be embarrassed. That's right.

359
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,541
And I should be apologizing to you
for your embarrassment.

360
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,333
Well, I wasn't embarrassed either.

361
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:10,458
That's a relief, for me, even though
you said you couldn't hear anything.

362
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,291
- Exactly.
- So, yeah.

363
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:16,625
Anyway, nice to meet you,
but I'm a little hungry, so...

364
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,375
I'm gonna go get myself a <i>snack.</i>

365
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,541
Damn it.

366
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,625
What's going on over there?

367
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:34,791
I don't know.

368
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:38,125
It looks like you got nominated
for Homecoming King.

369
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:39,541
What?

370
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,666
Who the hell put your name on the ballot?

371
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,166
I did.

372
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:49,916
- Nice work, Tiny Flynn.
- Oh, you look so cute!

373
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,541
- Hey, pretty lady!
- Hey. Oh, I'm glad you're here.

374
00:19:55,625 --> 00:20:00,000
A package arrived today
with your name on it from Boston.

375
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,791
What? Oh, my gosh!

376
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,875
Oh, my gosh! This is so cute!

377
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,500
Oh, I love it!

378
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:13,875
Ooh, there's a card!

379
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:20,833
<i> Elle, sent you a hoodie</i>
<i>to keep you warm for your trip to Boston.</i>

380
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,083
<i>If you're up for it.</i>

381
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,875
Wait, what?

382
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:30,291
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my God, it's a ticket to Boston!

383
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,541
- You're gonna love it there!
- Oh!

384
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,041
So, can you make it?

385
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,041
Ta-da!

386
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:39,000
So, my answer is a firm yes!

387
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,500
Yeah, okay.
I think that's the responsible choice.

388
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,500
Well, I guess you're right,
because how else would I be able

389
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:47,958
- to do all my college interviews?
- Wait, you're applying to schools here?

390
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,958
I already sent out applications
to Boston University,

391
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,041
Tufts, Boston College...

392
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,458
And Harvard?

393
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,041
Yes, and Harvard.

394
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,041
- Noah, come on!
- Brilliant!

395
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,041
We're going.

396
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:06,375
Shit, I'm so sorry. I forgot, I've got
some karaoke today. Gotta get ready.

397
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,000
<i>Guys, yo, say hello to Elle.</i>

398
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,791
<i>- Oh.</i>
<i>- Hi, Elle!</i>

399
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:11,708
Hi!

400
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,791
<i>- Hello, boys!
- Chloe, how are you?</i>

401
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,125
<i>So, who's singing tonight, then?</i>

402
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,541
Yes? Oh, my God. Get dressed, naked boy.

403
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:21,791
<i>Scandalous!</i>

404
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,541
Hey, babe, I'm sorry. This is, uh...
This is great news,

405
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:32,041
<i>but I gotta go,
so we can talk about this tomorrow?</i>

406
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,500
Okay, sure...

407
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,458
<i>- All right, bye.</i>
- I can't wait to meet...

408
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,291
everyone.

409
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:53,083
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

410
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:00,000
<i>I know I'm gonna regret this.</i>

411
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,958
<i>"Chloe Winthrop."</i>

412
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:17,958
<i>Oh, just your run-of-the-mill,
breathtaking supermodel goddess.</i>

413
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:19,291
<i>No worries there.</i>

414
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,250
<i>Not sure I even wanna see this...</i>

415
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:32,916
<i>Holy crap! That's a lot of money.</i>

416
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:35,500
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

417
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:44,250
<i>"The best thing to hold on to in life...</i>

418
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:47,250
<i>is each other."</i>

419
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:53,416
<i>It was that night I decided</i>
<i>to hold on to Noah.</i>

420
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,833
- Hey, Dad.
- Yeah.

421
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:59,666
Could I talk to you for a second?

422
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:02,500
Yeah, sure. Shoot.

423
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:09,333
Um, it's just about school.

424
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:13,500
I just want to know how much we, like...
Figure out, what do we, like, have to...

425
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:15,625
How much money we have for tuition.

426
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:17,833
Yeah, um...

427
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,375
I kinda think I need to know.

428
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:21,916
You know, I...

429
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
I thought you wanted to go to UC Berkeley.

430
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:26,541
No, I do, I do. It's just...

431
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:30,250
you know, I think it's smart to apply
to some backup schools too.

432
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:33,541
And some of those schools are private.

433
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:35,625
Mm-hmm.

434
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,958
You know, without some sort
of financial aid and your help,

435
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:42,708
I'm not so sure we can afford
a more expensive college.

436
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:46,333
Don't forget I still have to pay
for Brad's school.

437
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:50,041
Oh... I didn't think of that.

438
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:52,416
- I'm sorry, Elle. You know, if I could...
- Look, Dad,

439
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,666
I totally understand. It's not a problem.

440
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,375
Okay.

441
00:23:57,625 --> 00:24:00,375
<i>This is definitely a problem.</i>

442
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:03,875
<i>Welcome to Senior Field Day.</i>

443
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:06,458
<i>Please report to the parking lot
to pick your teams.</i>

444
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:09,166
Let's see... Okay, Ollie...

445
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,458
All right, I am thinking we go
for poundage on this one, right?

446
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:12,916
Like, Tuppen would just be so...

447
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I feel you,
but can you trust me on this one?

448
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:17,875
Miles is phenomenal at volleyball.

449
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,625
Student Council President Miles?

450
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:23,166
Yeah. He's amazing.

451
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:25,625
Let's go, Evans, come on.
Who's it gonna be?

452
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,958
- Trust me.
- Let's go! Come on.

453
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:29,958
Uh, we're gonna go with Miles!

454
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:32,833
- Okay, Miles, you're up.
- Me?

455
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:34,250
Yeah, you.

456
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:36,500
Whoo! Here's a team shirt, my dude.

457
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:39,041
- Let's do it.
- And, Marco, who's it gonna be?

458
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:41,125
We'll take the big guy.

459
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,666
Whoo!

460
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,416
Tuppen. They've got Tuppen.

461
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:47,166
Good luck, Capt. Evans.

462
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:49,083
We're fine. We're good.

463
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:51,208
On your marks. Get set.

464
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:52,333
Elle, your shoe's untied.

465
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,083
What? Oh, thanks.

466
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:55,208
Go!

467
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:57,000
<i>Did I actually just fall for that?</i>

468
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:57,916
Oh!

469
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:02,750
Go!

470
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:06,958
One, two, three, toss!

471
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:11,375
Unh-unh-unh!

472
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:18,250
Go! Go! Go!

473
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:21,708
What!

474
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:25,791
Oh, my God! Pull!

475
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:28,083
Marco Polo!

476
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:34,833
Pull!

477
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:39,958
Oh, my gosh!

478
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:41,833
Whoa!

479
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:43,791
- Oh!
- No, focus!

480
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,333
- Oh, ho-ho-ho!
- Focus!

481
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:50,041
Yeah, yeah!

482
00:25:51,791 --> 00:25:55,333
Oh, whoa, whoa!

483
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:05,083
All right, he's good. Whoo! Let's go!

484
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:09,958
Pull! Pull!

485
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:10,916
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

486
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:20,333
Come on, Elle!

487
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,583
Need a hand?

488
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:24,166
Oh! Hell no!

489
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,208
Have it your way.
See you at the finish line!

490
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:28,791
You can do it! Come on!

491
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,791
Oh!

492
00:26:57,666 --> 00:26:58,958
Hey, while we're down here,

493
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:01,041
should we maybe go by that place
with the thingy?

494
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:03,291
Oh, my God! Of course. Rule number 21.

495
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:05,250
Should we do rule number 2?

496
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:08,500
- But also rule number 4.
- But also, hey! Rule number 18!

497
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:09,958
- Exactly! Oh, my God! Exactly!
- Whoo!

498
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:11,958
Hey, you know what?
I think I'll head home.

499
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:13,583
Really? Is everything okay?

500
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,458
Yeah, I'm just not feeling well.

501
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:19,208
Oh, okay, yeah.

502
00:27:19,791 --> 00:27:20,625
Bye.

503
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:21,916
Feel better.

504
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,833
Thanks.

505
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:26,541
Hey, are you guys okay?

506
00:27:26,916 --> 00:27:28,958
Uh, yeah, I... I think so.

507
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:31,666
I'd better just give her a call later.

508
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,583
Yeah.

509
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:34,458
You know, Elle,

510
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:38,416
- assuming I'm the dumbest person ever.
- You used to never be good at this.

511
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,791
What's the capital of Pennsylvania?

512
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:41,583
Wait a second.

513
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:42,916
Is that Marco?

514
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:30,125
All right, let's go.

515
00:28:30,916 --> 00:28:32,958
Hey, guys! Hold up!

516
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:35,125
That was really good, dude.

517
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:36,166
- I'm impressed.
- Thanks.

518
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:37,500
What'd you think, Elle?

519
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:40,958
Oh, you know, my opinion doesn't <i>really</i>
matter. I'm sure you're impressed

520
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:43,375
- with yourself enough for the both of us.
- Oh!

521
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:45,000
Your friend doesn't like me very much.

522
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:46,791
She's still upset
about losing on Field Day.

523
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:48,541
- Oh!
- Anyways,

524
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:50,541
so, is this how you spend your Fridays?

525
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:53,583
Just wooing the women of Santa Monica
with your fancy guitar?

526
00:28:54,416 --> 00:28:55,416
Any requests?

527
00:28:55,916 --> 00:28:57,000
- Kissing booth...
- Know what?

528
00:28:57,083 --> 00:28:59,166
That's a shame that we have made plans.

529
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:02,416
But we wouldn't wanna pull you away
from your adoring fans,

530
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,125
so we'll see you later, Marco.

531
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:06,333
Don't do that to me! Come on!

532
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:12,250
I'm not asking Marco to do the booth.

533
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,083
- I don't want to.
- I'm telling you.

534
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:16,458
You know, give it a rest, man.
I'm not doing it.

535
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:24,166
No.

536
00:29:29,416 --> 00:29:32,000
Oh, son of a bitch!

537
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:04,833
Come on. Come on, baby.

538
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,333
Ooh! That might do it!

539
00:30:10,416 --> 00:30:12,875
- Yes! We still got it!
- Whew!

540
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:15,791
I love the smell of victory!

541
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:18,375
- Oh, my goodness!
- Wait! Do I smell?

542
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,583
- No, you're good.
- Cool.

543
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:31,666
<i> And there it was.</i>

544
00:30:31,791 --> 00:30:34,208
<i>A way to make a boatload of money</i>

545
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:37,166
<i>that could help cover the cost
of school in Boston.</i>

546
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,875
<i>The money was real
and could make things easier for Dad,</i>

547
00:30:40,958 --> 00:30:43,500
<i>no matter which school
I ended up getting into.</i>

548
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,333
Wait,
you're not actually thinking we could...

549
00:30:47,416 --> 00:30:49,416
Uh, win the freestyle category?

550
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,708
That's exactly what I'm thinking.

551
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:54,083
Well, actually,
we are pretty good at this, aren't we?

552
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:56,958
Pretty good?
We've had the top score for four years.

553
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:58,958
Ooh-ooh-ooh!
We could even make team T-shirts.

554
00:30:59,416 --> 00:31:02,333
Yes! Team T-shirts! Why not?
Sure! I love it!

555
00:31:02,416 --> 00:31:04,916
But if we're gonna do it,
we have to do this right, okay?

556
00:31:05,541 --> 00:31:07,750
Training starts tomorrow
at seven a.m. sharp.

557
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:10,958
Wait. Training?

558
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:21,375
<i>"What do you want to be</i>
<i>in five years?"</i>

559
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:23,458
<i>Is a difficult question to answer</i>

560
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:26,333
<i>because as soon as I start to figure out
one thing,</i>

561
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:32,416
<i>something or someone changes
and makes me question everything.</i>

562
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:35,500
<i>And if I'm not sure what I am right now,</i>

563
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:38,916
<i>how could I possibly know
what I want to be in five years?</i>

564
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:41,958
Hey, you!

565
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:45,458
Hey, I'm sorry.
Some of the guys were over studying.

566
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,333
<i>That's why I didn't call sooner.</i>

567
00:31:47,416 --> 00:31:50,208
No worries.
I'm glad you're making friends out there.

568
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,083
<i>And in two more sleeps,</i>

569
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:54,625
I get to come see you
and meet all of them.

570
00:31:54,708 --> 00:31:57,333
Yeah, but we don't have to spend
the entire weekend with them though.

571
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:59,416
No, I want to get to know them.

572
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:02,375
<i>Well, one of them, at least.</i>

573
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:05,791
Five, six, seven, eight.

574
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:07,708
One and two and three and four

575
00:32:07,791 --> 00:32:09,291
and five, six, seven, eight.

576
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:11,125
And one and two and three and four

577
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:14,000
- and five, six... whoa!
- Ugh, sorry!

578
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:15,166
God! We should take a break!

579
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,625
Come on, I just want
to get in one more hour of practice

580
00:32:17,708 --> 00:32:19,166
before I leave for Boston tomorrow.

581
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,625
We only have nine weeks
to get ready!

582
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:24,916
Do you think that you're maybe just taking
this, like, a little bit too seriously?

583
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:26,166
It is serious!

584
00:32:26,708 --> 00:32:28,458
I didn't...

585
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:31,416
I didn't want to say anything before,
but...

586
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:37,708
I really need the money for school.

587
00:32:42,083 --> 00:32:43,041
Let's do it.

588
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:48,416
Oh, God! Look who's here.

589
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:51,416
Ooh! This is perfect.
We need a headliner for the booth.

590
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,250
- No!
- Everyone's obsessed with him!

591
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:54,333
Why?

592
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:57,250
You promised the hottest kissers.

593
00:32:57,333 --> 00:33:00,291
Like last year, you get him,
everyone else will just fall in line.

594
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:02,833
Ugh!

595
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:06,458
- Fine.
- Come on.

596
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:08,125
Hey!

597
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:11,083
You two do go everywhere together.

598
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,333
Uh, yeah, yeah, we do.

599
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:16,708
Anyway, uh, I... sorry.

600
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:19,916
<i>We </i>wanted to, uh, ask you something.

601
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:23,125
We do this kissing booth
at the Homecoming fundraiser,

602
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:26,750
and we were wondering if you'd be one
of our kissers this year.

603
00:33:28,291 --> 00:33:29,125
No.

604
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,583
No.

605
00:33:30,916 --> 00:33:31,750
Why no?

606
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:33,541
- I have my reasons.
- Come on, dude!

607
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:34,791
It's the most popular booth!

608
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:36,791
And it's for charity.

609
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:38,458
Don't you believe in charity?

610
00:33:38,541 --> 00:33:41,875
- I'm standing here talking to you.
- Hey! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

611
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:43,708
That was a good... one.

612
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:48,375
Okay.

613
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,500
I'll make you a deal.

614
00:33:51,875 --> 00:33:53,666
I'll play you any game here for it.

615
00:33:54,458 --> 00:33:55,458
<i>Holy shit!</i>

616
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,583
You win, I do the booth.

617
00:33:58,125 --> 00:33:59,333
I win,

618
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:02,083
you babysit my sister for free.

619
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:03,791
Let me talk with my colleague.

620
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,750
Okay. Fine.

621
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:15,125
Uh... any game.

622
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:17,000
<i>And now to set the trap.</i>

623
00:34:17,916 --> 00:34:20,708
Any game except... that one.

624
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:24,166
- No, no, no. I said any game.
- Okay, but that one's...

625
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:26,750
Well, yeah, but that one's so hard.

626
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,833
<i>Bingo!</i>

627
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:31,625
Okay, all right. Fine.

628
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,916
- Your choice.
- Sweet!

629
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:38,833
Oh, my God!
We got him right where we want him!

630
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:45,000
All righty.

631
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,541
Here you go.

632
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:10,833
- Uh, hey, dude, what's your last name?
- Peña.

633
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:14,875
Middle name, Valentin.

634
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:16,500
<i>MVP?</i>

635
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:19,125
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

636
00:35:33,708 --> 00:35:36,375
- Yeah! Yes! Yes!
- Yes! Yes!

637
00:35:37,958 --> 00:35:39,625
- Yes!
- Oh, my gosh! Yes!

638
00:35:39,708 --> 00:35:42,916
Is this how you spend your Friday nights?
Conning people on the DDM machine?

639
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,041
See you at the booth, MVP! Oh, and, um...

640
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:49,583
you can leave the guitar at home.

641
00:35:49,666 --> 00:35:52,541
Ay! Ooh-hoo-hoo!

642
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:55,708
See ya!

643
00:35:55,833 --> 00:35:56,791
Oh, my gosh, that was crazy!

644
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:58,250
- We got Marco!
<i>- You</i> got Marco.

645
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:00,083
- And we have the OMGs.
- Definitely.

646
00:36:00,166 --> 00:36:03,375
- And you think Rachel would do it?
- Oh, shit! Rachel!

647
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:05,500
- What?
- No, no, no!

648
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:07,791
No, no, I was supposed to hang out
with Rachel tonight.

649
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:09,916
- I have to leave right now! Bye!
- Yeah, go, go!

650
00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:23,041
I'm so sorry.

651
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:24,208
I was practicing with Elle.

652
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:26,250
Look, Lee.

653
00:36:27,041 --> 00:36:30,458
I know that Elle is your best friend,
but this has gotta stop.

654
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:33,000
- I mean, ever since Noah left...
- She's always around.

655
00:36:33,083 --> 00:36:35,000
Exactly! You gotta say something to her.

656
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:37,875
I know, and I'm sorry,
but please don't blame her for this, okay?

657
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:38,916
I'm the one who forgot.

658
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
But it's not just tonight.

659
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:42,875
She's always inviting herself
or just showing up.

660
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:45,708
She's lonely! I can't tell her
we don't want her hanging out with us.

661
00:36:45,791 --> 00:36:47,791
But you can leave me standing
at the movie theater

662
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:49,666
for 45 minutes just fine?

663
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:54,875
Listen, Lee. If you...

664
00:36:58,125 --> 00:37:00,041
if you can't make
your best friend understand

665
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:02,125
that this relationship is important,

666
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,125
then I don't think we have a relationship.

667
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:09,583
- Rachel, I can't just tell her...
- Just figure out your priorities, Lee.

668
00:37:10,416 --> 00:37:12,833
If I'm one of them,
then go and tell Elle that I am.

669
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:17,458
Good night.

670
00:37:27,708 --> 00:37:31,625
I can't believe she got that mad
about you being late one time.

671
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:33,666
Well...

672
00:37:34,708 --> 00:37:36,875
it's a little bit more complicated
than that.

673
00:37:38,041 --> 00:37:40,083
You okay?

674
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:43,625
I'm just a little nervous about Boston.

675
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:45,541
Don't worry about it.

676
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:46,791
It's just Noah.

677
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:49,083
Yeah.

678
00:37:51,125 --> 00:37:52,166
I love you.

679
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,708
- I love you.
- See you when you're back, yeah?

680
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:55,833
- Yep. Bye.
- Bye.

681
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:11,833
<i>But when it's been a while</i>
<i>since you've seen someone,</i>

682
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:14,625
<i>you do worry.</i>

683
00:38:15,458 --> 00:38:17,375
<i>You worry you've let your guard down.</i>

684
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:20,166
<i>You worry they don't miss you.</i>

685
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:23,083
<i>And if it's been a while,</i>

686
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:26,208
<i>you even worry you forgot how
to kiss them.</i>

687
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:29,291
<i>You worry about everything.</i>

688
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:35,875
<i>There's my guy.</i>

689
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:40,583
<i>But now,</i>

690
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:43,416
<i>I'm not worried about a damn thing.</i>

691
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,416
Hi!

692
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:54,666
You ready for Boston?

693
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,458
<i>Noah Flynn, you have no idea.</i>

694
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:10,291
Whoa!

695
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:14,250
I don't know.

696
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:17,916
I just keep thinking about how different
my life is right now.

697
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,083
You know what I mean?

698
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:22,916
And if I even think about my interviews,
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

699
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,833
Elle, stop.

700
00:40:25,583 --> 00:40:28,791
You're gonna blow 'em away. Okay?

701
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:33,500
Well, thank you, but we'll see about that.

702
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:39,125
Um.. can I be honest real quickly?

703
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:40,125
Mm-hmm.

704
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:42,166
Like, later, when we leave here,

705
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,166
I was thinking, like,
if it's okay with you,

706
00:40:46,916 --> 00:40:51,833
I'm going to treat you
like my own personal jungle gym.

707
00:40:56,791 --> 00:40:57,625
Check!

708
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,666
I love this city.

709
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:19,333
I love this girl.

710
00:42:12,708 --> 00:42:14,333
So, just before we get in there,

711
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:15,875
these guys are cool,

712
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:18,875
but they are a little intense.

713
00:42:18,958 --> 00:42:21,041
Noah, I'm fine.

714
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:23,333
- Okay?
- Yes! Come on!

715
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:29,166
Okay,
that's not what that case was at all.

716
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:33,166
Oh, Citizens United was a classic example
of judicial activism, right?

717
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,416
- True. Correct.
- After conservatives bellyached for years

718
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,916
- about the liberal Supremes.
- Same thing.

719
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,500
- You are a hypocrite at its finest.
- Told you they were intense!

720
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:41,875
No! That was not...

721
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:44,125
<i>The only person I wanted</i>
<i>to meet isn't here.</i>

722
00:42:44,208 --> 00:42:45,708
One word and an acronym!

723
00:42:45,791 --> 00:42:47,666
<i>I wonder if it was on purpose.</i>

724
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:50,916
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys!
Look who's here.

725
00:43:01,625 --> 00:43:04,833
Oh, James!

726
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,375
She knows virtually everybody in here!

727
00:43:07,458 --> 00:43:08,583
She knows how to work a room.

728
00:43:08,666 --> 00:43:11,666
So I hear you got something special
for us tonight? I'm excited.

729
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:15,125
- Hello, hello, hello!
- Hey! How are you?

730
00:43:15,208 --> 00:43:17,750
- You look so good! So dashing!
- Nice to see you!

731
00:43:18,041 --> 00:43:21,083
Oh, hello, gorgeous. Mmm!

732
00:43:21,958 --> 00:43:23,625
- So good to see you.
- You look beautiful.

733
00:43:23,708 --> 00:43:26,000
Thank you!

734
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:28,666
- Come, join us!
- Thanks for answering my call.

735
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:31,333
- So, where were you?
- I actually have no excuse,

736
00:43:31,416 --> 00:43:34,333
but I'll make it up to you tonight
on the dance floor.

737
00:43:34,958 --> 00:43:37,833
- Oh, my God. Wait, no, is this Elle?
- Yeah.

738
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:43,666
I have heard so much about you.
Seriously. My God, you're gorgeous.

739
00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:45,041
You...

740
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:46,875
You're gorgeous.

741
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,291
I love her already.

742
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,333
Too bad this one here's so ugly,
though, isn't it?

743
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:53,750
- Oh!
- Burn!

744
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:58,625
But he does do as he's told,
so I keep him around.

745
00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:01,250
- Oh! Oh, Noah.
<i>- I bet you do.</i>

746
00:44:02,125 --> 00:44:03,208
So, where were you?

747
00:44:03,666 --> 00:44:06,750
So, today, total disaster.
The sculptor dropped out...

748
00:44:06,833 --> 00:44:09,125
So, I'm in Zimbabwe, ten years old.

749
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:11,708
My mom was doing a research paper
on the Ndebele tribe,

750
00:44:11,791 --> 00:44:13,708
and we're gliding down the Zambezi River,

751
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:17,083
and suddenly, we realize we're
in the middle of a mother hippo

752
00:44:17,166 --> 00:44:20,708
and a baby hippo, and suddenly,
this mouth opens up...

753
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,958
- Get out of here!
- Out of nowhere and bam!

754
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:25,541
Bit off the front of the boat!
So, the boat starts sinking,

755
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:27,958
and everyone is swimming to the side,
and my mother's like,

756
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:29,958
"Chloe, Chloe, Chloe, are you okay?"

757
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:31,291
I open my eyes and I'm like...

758
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:35,416
- "Can we go again?"
- No way! You are insane.

759
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,666
All right! Shots!

760
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:38,083
Shots, shots!

761
00:44:38,166 --> 00:44:40,291
You know, we actually... we need to go.

762
00:44:40,375 --> 00:44:42,125
No! So early?

763
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:45,291
No. Elle's got college interviews
tomorrow, so...

764
00:44:45,708 --> 00:44:46,666
Well, in that case,

765
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,000
here's to Elle kicking ass
at her interviews tomorrow.

766
00:44:49,083 --> 00:44:49,958
- Let's do it.
- To Elle.

767
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:52,000
- To Elle!
- You're welcome.

768
00:44:52,083 --> 00:44:54,625
<i>Hmm.</i>
<i>Tell you whose ass I'd like to kick.</i>

769
00:44:59,958 --> 00:45:02,291
Well, Miss Evans,
that seems to be about it.

770
00:45:02,958 --> 00:45:04,833
Thank you for coming in today
to meet with us.

771
00:45:04,916 --> 00:45:07,583
Thank you for having me.
It was a pleasure.

772
00:45:11,916 --> 00:45:13,500
- Elle.
- Yeah.

773
00:45:13,791 --> 00:45:15,791
Do you mind
if I give you a piece of advice?

774
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:24,291
I had the feeling that you were searching

775
00:45:24,375 --> 00:45:26,875
for the perfect answer
to a lot of my questions.

776
00:45:27,833 --> 00:45:30,708
You should know that we're less interested
in meeting the person

777
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:32,250
you think we want you to be

778
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,625
and far more interested in getting to know
the person you really are.

779
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:43,000
Thank you.

780
00:46:42,791 --> 00:46:45,416
Hello.

781
00:46:49,916 --> 00:46:50,750
What's going on?

782
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,750
Is everything okay?

783
00:46:54,166 --> 00:46:55,375
Gotta get to the airport.

784
00:46:56,208 --> 00:46:57,166
Talk to me. What's up?

785
00:46:57,666 --> 00:47:00,000
If you wanna talk to someone,
just check your phone.

786
00:47:01,625 --> 00:47:03,916
Elle! Elle!

787
00:47:06,166 --> 00:47:07,958
<i>Life throws curves at you.</i>

788
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:09,916
<i>You think it's moving one way,</i>

789
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,250
<i>and suddenly realize it's heading back
in the opposite direction.</i>

790
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:17,083
<i>So it's difficult to know what you'll want
in five years.</i>

791
00:47:17,833 --> 00:47:19,500
<i>When that curve comes flying at you</i>

792
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:22,208
<i>and you're not sure
whether you should try to hit it,</i>

793
00:47:22,583 --> 00:47:25,666
<i>catch it, or just step out of the way.</i>

794
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:30,416
<i>Dad, I just wanted to explore my options,
okay?</i>

795
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,875
Elle, it's not about any of that.

796
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:36,375
It's about you asking yourself

797
00:47:36,458 --> 00:47:38,583
if you think a relationship
with Noah's gonna last

798
00:47:38,666 --> 00:47:41,375
and if it's worth changing all
of your plans for him.

799
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:45,875
Do you?

800
00:47:48,125 --> 00:47:49,083
I'm not sure.

801
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:08,416
Hey.

802
00:48:08,791 --> 00:48:09,833
<i>Hey.</i>

803
00:48:09,916 --> 00:48:12,458
I figured that we should talk.

804
00:48:13,666 --> 00:48:15,541
Why were you so upset when you left?

805
00:48:17,583 --> 00:48:18,958
Well, um...

806
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:25,625
I guess I was looking at this whole life
that you have out there without me

807
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:27,291
<i>and I'm...</i>

808
00:48:28,833 --> 00:48:32,250
I'm definitely not used to seeing you
around all those college girls.

809
00:48:32,333 --> 00:48:34,458
Elle, I told you, Chloe's just a friend.

810
00:48:35,166 --> 00:48:37,041
<i>How did you know I meant her?</i>

811
00:48:37,625 --> 00:48:38,666
Okay.

812
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,208
You don't sound convinced.

813
00:48:41,541 --> 00:48:42,750
I wanna believe you.

814
00:48:42,833 --> 00:48:44,625
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't.

815
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,541
<i>Except one reason.</i>

816
00:48:47,916 --> 00:48:50,208
If you're telling me
thatnothing has happened...

817
00:48:52,875 --> 00:48:54,000
then I believe you.

818
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:56,333
Good.

819
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:00,375
You know I love you.

820
00:49:02,041 --> 00:49:03,125
I love you too.

821
00:49:04,291 --> 00:49:05,625
I'm really glad we talked.

822
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:08,083
<i>- I'll call you tomorrow, okay?</i>
- Okay.

823
00:49:42,208 --> 00:49:43,375
Hey.

824
00:49:43,916 --> 00:49:47,166
Oh, hello, handsome.
I'm outside. Buzz me up?

825
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,041
Yeah, okay. See you in a bit.

826
00:49:51,375 --> 00:49:54,291
- Uh... what is this?
- You, my dear,

827
00:49:54,375 --> 00:49:56,375
have been a magnificent bore
since Elle left,

828
00:49:56,458 --> 00:49:58,833
so I'm taking you out for some fun.

829
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:03,333
I think you're good for me.

830
00:50:04,416 --> 00:50:07,166
Tell me something I don't know.

831
00:50:11,958 --> 00:50:14,166
Damn it! I'm so sorry, Elle!

832
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,125
That's okay. All right.

833
00:50:16,208 --> 00:50:19,041
- I just can't get this!
- Yes, you can. Yes, you can.

834
00:50:19,125 --> 00:50:21,541
- I know you will.
- I know how much this means to you.

835
00:50:22,708 --> 00:50:24,416
I hate that I'm letting you down.

836
00:50:25,166 --> 00:50:27,416
Hey, Lee, hey! Look at me.

837
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:32,791
You have literally been letting me down
your entire life.

838
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:41,666
Oh, man.

839
00:50:42,666 --> 00:50:44,416
So, how was it with Noah?

840
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,791
I think he might be...

841
00:50:47,916 --> 00:50:51,375
<i>I wanted to tell Lee everything
about Noah,</i>

842
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:54,166
<i>the earring, even my interviews,</i>

843
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:57,250
<i>but honestly,
I didn't even know where to begin.</i>

844
00:50:57,333 --> 00:51:00,291
It was so fun. Yeah,
we had a really good time.

845
00:51:00,708 --> 00:51:03,500
- Okay.
- How about Rachel? How's that?

846
00:51:04,083 --> 00:51:06,958
Uh, pretty much the same
as before you left.

847
00:51:07,041 --> 00:51:09,750
I'm sorry. Don't worry, though.

848
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:12,375
You'll come up with something
to make her come around.

849
00:51:12,458 --> 00:51:13,291
Yeah.

850
00:51:17,583 --> 00:51:18,500
Yeah, I will.

851
00:51:21,125 --> 00:51:21,958
Wanna practice?

852
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:24,000
- Let's do it!
- Okay, cool.

853
00:51:24,083 --> 00:51:26,416
And then drop you.
When do I not drop you?

854
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,833
- Oh, that's right. Ever.
- That part where you don't drop me.

855
00:51:28,916 --> 00:51:30,166
Five, six, seven, eight.

856
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:35,125
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

857
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:42,083
Oh, my God, are you okay?

858
00:51:42,166 --> 00:51:44,041
- Ow!
- Whoa! Are you okay?

859
00:51:44,125 --> 00:51:45,875
- My ankle!
- Let me get you some ice.

860
00:51:45,958 --> 00:51:46,958
Damn it!

861
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:48,750
Oh!

862
00:51:52,958 --> 00:51:53,875
How's that feel?

863
00:51:55,166 --> 00:51:56,291
- Better.
- Okay.

864
00:51:58,083 --> 00:52:00,458
Listen, Elle,
I am so sorry about the competition.

865
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:01,708
It's okay.

866
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:07,375
Wait, actually...

867
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:10,625
you know who could totally replace me?

868
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,041
No, no, no!

869
00:52:15,125 --> 00:52:17,916
Yeah, yes! MVP! Come on! He's perfect!

870
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:18,916
No!

871
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,041
Don't you still need the money for school?

872
00:52:22,791 --> 00:52:23,625
Yeah, but...

873
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:25,958
Well, he's better than me,
and we both know it.

874
00:52:26,375 --> 00:52:28,416
With him, you could actually win.

875
00:52:30,666 --> 00:52:33,125
- Well, he's not gonna wanna do it.
- I'll <i>get </i>him to do it.

876
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:36,541
There's no way I'm gonna do it.

877
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:37,666
Why not?

878
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:41,625
I'm already doing your kissing booth,
which I didn't want to do, and now this?

879
00:52:41,708 --> 00:52:43,375
I'm only asking 'cause of my ankle.

880
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:48,833
- I can't believe she'd want me to do it.
- No, she does.

881
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,291
She knows how good you are.

882
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:52,541
- And she really wants you to.
- Really?

883
00:52:54,416 --> 00:52:55,250
Hey.

884
00:52:55,333 --> 00:52:56,166
Oh, hey.

885
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:58,541
- So what is it?
- He'll do it.

886
00:52:58,958 --> 00:53:00,250
- What?
- He's totally on board.

887
00:53:00,666 --> 00:53:03,625
- What did you have to do?
- Nothing! He really wanted to.

888
00:53:03,708 --> 00:53:04,541
Really?

889
00:53:11,958 --> 00:53:13,000
There you are.

890
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:14,291
I'm here.

891
00:53:15,166 --> 00:53:16,000
Great.

892
00:53:16,375 --> 00:53:19,041
First of all, I just wanted to say

893
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:21,541
thank you for filling in for Lee.

894
00:53:22,041 --> 00:53:23,833
So I thought we could start
with the step patterns.

895
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:26,458
Yeah, I mean,
I guess we could start there.

896
00:53:28,166 --> 00:53:29,000
What?

897
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:31,750
Well, I just thought it might be better
to get the choreography down

898
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,541
and then focus on the step accuracy.

899
00:53:33,625 --> 00:53:35,666
Listen, I've watched hours
of these competitions,

900
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:38,083
and the winners always have
near-perfect footwork.

901
00:53:38,166 --> 00:53:40,541
But in freestyle,
the step accuracy is a given.

902
00:53:40,625 --> 00:53:42,166
It's the choreography
that wins over the judges.

903
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:45,625
Yeah, exactly, which is why we're
going to start with the step patterns

904
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:47,750
and then go to choreography, okay?

905
00:53:49,583 --> 00:53:50,416
Okay.

906
00:53:51,125 --> 00:53:51,958
Great.

907
00:53:55,166 --> 00:53:56,833
If that's the way you wanna do it.

908
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:04,041
Good morning, Los Angeles Country Day.

909
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:05,708
<i>Hope you all have your costumes ready</i>

910
00:54:05,791 --> 00:54:07,708
<i>- because the seniors have secured...</i>
- Hey!

911
00:54:07,791 --> 00:54:09,416
<i>- A very special venue...</i>
- Where's Lee?

912
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,208
<i>For the Halloween gala next weekend!</i>

913
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:14,041
Our quote of the day is brought to you
by William Shakesp... what the...

914
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:17,750
<i>- Give it back! Don't, Lee!</i>
<i>- Sorry. I'm sorry. Vivian!</i>

915
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:20,916
- Give that back!
- I'm sorry. Vivian, please, please!

916
00:54:21,416 --> 00:54:23,333
<i>I'm sorry. I just need a second.</i>

917
00:54:26,625 --> 00:54:28,375
Thank you.

918
00:54:28,458 --> 00:54:32,583
Hey, Rachel, it's me, Lee. Lee Flynn.

919
00:54:33,291 --> 00:54:35,875
Look, I'm uh...
I am totally getting detention for this,

920
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:40,000
but it's worth it because I really
just needed to talk to you.

921
00:54:40,375 --> 00:54:44,041
I am so, so sorry
about everything that happened,

922
00:54:45,041 --> 00:54:48,125
but most importantly,
I wanted you to know something.

923
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:50,333
I never told you this before, but...

924
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:54,833
I love you, Rachel.

925
00:54:58,458 --> 00:55:00,791
And I'm really hoping
that you love me too.

926
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:09,041
So would you please text me
a smiley face emoji for yes

927
00:55:09,125 --> 00:55:11,416
and a poop emoji for no, please?

928
00:55:16,458 --> 00:55:18,500
All right, Mr. Flynn. The show's over.

929
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:20,500
- Ahh.
- Let's go. Time for detention.

930
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:26,625
- Let's go.
- Okay.

931
00:55:26,708 --> 00:55:28,500
Come on. Let's go.

932
00:55:30,041 --> 00:55:33,083
Yes! Whoo-hoo! I got a smiley face!

933
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:36,250
Yeah! Whoo!

934
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,666
I got a smiley face! There's no poop!
Ha ha ha!

935
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:41,333
There's no poop here!

936
00:55:42,708 --> 00:55:44,750
<i>Hmm. He said he'd figure out a way.</i>

937
00:55:45,333 --> 00:55:47,500
<i>Guess Lee doesn't tell me everything.</i>

938
00:55:49,291 --> 00:55:51,541
Well, I'm just glad you finally said it.

939
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:55,041
So, what we talked about,

940
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,583
Elle always being around,

941
00:55:58,458 --> 00:55:59,791
did you speak to her?

942
00:56:00,625 --> 00:56:03,583
Don't worry. I took care of everything.

943
00:56:04,625 --> 00:56:07,000
She will be giving us plenty of space.

944
00:56:16,333 --> 00:56:18,916
Oh, my God,
loved your speech yesterday, Lee.

945
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:19,833
It was hot.

946
00:56:19,916 --> 00:56:21,500
Thank you. I was driven by love.

947
00:56:21,583 --> 00:56:23,625
And Rachel is so sweet.

948
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:28,000
- And you, I'd be devastated.
- So devastated!

949
00:56:28,083 --> 00:56:28,958
About what?

950
00:56:29,041 --> 00:56:33,666
You mean you haven't seen the Insta photos
of Flynn's new supermodel?

951
00:56:38,916 --> 00:56:40,958
Bye, Lee.

952
00:56:48,458 --> 00:56:51,916
<i>Sometimes there are things that get</i>
<i>so stuck in your head,</i>

953
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,583
<i>that there's only one way to get them out.</i>

954
00:57:03,833 --> 00:57:05,333
Hey, I'm at the gym. Can I call you back?

955
00:57:06,625 --> 00:57:09,916
Um, I kinda need to talk to you now,

956
00:57:10,333 --> 00:57:11,250
<i>actually.</i>

957
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:13,000
Okay. What's up?

958
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:16,000
<i>Okay. Here I go.</i>

959
00:57:16,375 --> 00:57:17,250
Um...

960
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:19,666
part of the reason I was so upset...

961
00:57:20,416 --> 00:57:21,583
<i>when I left Boston</i>

962
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,791
was because I found something
in your room.

963
00:57:26,708 --> 00:57:27,916
Okay, what'd you find?

964
00:57:30,416 --> 00:57:31,250
An earring,

965
00:57:32,625 --> 00:57:33,500
<i>under your bed,</i>

966
00:57:34,458 --> 00:57:37,916
and I wondered if it belongs to Chloe.

967
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,208
Elle, I promise you,

968
00:57:39,291 --> 00:57:42,000
I have absolutely no idea
how an earring got in my room.

969
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:45,416
That may be so, but... it was there...

970
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,291
Okay, I know what you thought.

971
00:57:47,833 --> 00:57:50,708
All right.
But I'm not sleeping with Chloe, okay?

972
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:53,416
I promise you. It could have been there
before I moved in.

973
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,416
It could be my roommate's ex-girlfriend's.
There's countless reasons.

974
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:59,208
It's just that knowing your past,
it's hard not to think...

975
00:57:59,291 --> 00:58:01,083
That's not fair. At all.

976
00:58:01,833 --> 00:58:04,125
Have I ever given you reason to doubt me?

977
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,083
No.

978
00:58:07,166 --> 00:58:10,000
Okay. Then I'm asking you to trust me.

979
00:58:12,375 --> 00:58:13,208
Please.

980
00:58:14,333 --> 00:58:17,041
<i>It was heartbreaking</i>
<i>to hear Noah talk this way,</i>

981
00:58:17,125 --> 00:58:21,000
<i>and I knew everything for us depended
on what I said next.</i>

982
00:58:25,375 --> 00:58:26,208
All right.

983
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:29,000
I believe you.

984
00:58:30,083 --> 00:58:30,916
Okay.

985
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,333
I wish you'd brought it up sooner, but...

986
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:37,250
I'm glad you told me.

987
00:58:38,416 --> 00:58:40,291
<i>When you're not sure</i>
<i>where you stand,</i>

988
00:58:40,375 --> 00:58:44,291
<i>sometimes a leap of faith
is the only move you can make.</i>

989
00:58:57,625 --> 00:59:00,708
Okay, okay. Hang on, hang on, hang on.
You're missing all the steps.

990
00:59:00,791 --> 00:59:02,166
How can we fix that?

991
00:59:02,958 --> 00:59:06,208
Okay, listen. I'm not worried about that.
The precision will come.

992
00:59:06,291 --> 00:59:08,750
What we need is something
that'll really blow the judges away.

993
00:59:08,833 --> 00:59:10,375
We can't even get this routine right,

994
00:59:10,458 --> 00:59:13,208
- and you want to make it more complicated?
- I want to make it more fun!

995
00:59:13,291 --> 00:59:14,833
That's what the audience wants.

996
00:59:15,958 --> 00:59:16,958
Something like this.

997
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:31,375
<i>Holy shit!</i>

998
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,333
Oh!

999
00:59:51,333 --> 00:59:53,875
Sneaky, sneaky boy.

1000
00:59:56,583 --> 00:59:58,500
Busted.

1001
00:59:58,625 --> 01:00:00,541
Walking pretty well, aren't we?

1002
01:00:00,666 --> 01:00:03,083
I'm sorry. Okay?
You had a better shot with Marco,

1003
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:06,000
and I knew you wouldn't kick me
off the team, so I did it for you.

1004
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:09,166
Are you mad?

1005
01:00:09,791 --> 01:00:12,291
No. How could I be?

1006
01:00:14,208 --> 01:00:15,166
- Oh, let's go.
- Okay.

1007
01:00:15,666 --> 01:00:19,166
Oh, shut up! I'll show you a hurt ankle.

1008
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:21,708
So, how is it going with Marco?

1009
01:00:22,416 --> 01:00:25,375
- It is just fine.
- Really?

1010
01:00:26,416 --> 01:00:28,708
No. Don't even ask.

1011
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:32,458
Oh! By the way, so I know we were gonna go
as s'mores for the Halloween dance...

1012
01:00:32,541 --> 01:00:36,250
I think we have a winner!

1013
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:40,125
But I have a different idea
for our Halloween costume

1014
01:00:40,208 --> 01:00:41,750
that I wanted to run by you.

1015
01:00:42,333 --> 01:00:44,291
Check my bag.

1016
01:00:44,375 --> 01:00:45,666
Better than s'mores?

1017
01:00:48,875 --> 01:00:50,541
Uh, yeah!

1018
01:00:50,625 --> 01:00:51,875
- Right?
- Oh, my gosh!

1019
01:00:51,958 --> 01:00:53,166
- Should we do it?
- Obviously!

1020
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:55,208
Knew you'd love it,
I know you so frickin' well!

1021
01:00:55,291 --> 01:00:56,833
- This is a winner.
- I knew you'd love it.

1022
01:00:56,916 --> 01:00:58,708
Love it!

1023
01:01:14,625 --> 01:01:15,791
<i>Flynn's phone.</i>

1024
01:01:16,291 --> 01:01:17,916
Uh, hi.

1025
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,875
Is, uh... is Noah around?

1026
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,750
I think he went to a concert.
I guess he left his phone here.

1027
01:01:23,833 --> 01:01:25,500
Oh, um...

1028
01:01:26,291 --> 01:01:28,250
Any idea who he might have gone with?

1029
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:30,125
I think he went with Chloe.

1030
01:01:31,916 --> 01:01:33,125
Oh. Uh...

1031
01:01:33,583 --> 01:01:35,291
okay, uh, thanks.

1032
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:36,375
<i>All right. Bye.</i>

1033
01:01:46,333 --> 01:01:47,250
Whoo!

1034
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,500
Seriously?

1035
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:52,875
What is the big deal?

1036
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:56,250
Oh, my God! The big deal is that
the competition is literally in four weeks

1037
01:01:56,333 --> 01:01:59,416
- and the routine is a complete nightmare!
- I think you're exaggerating.

1038
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:03,250
No, listen, if you don't want to take this
seriously, we should just call it off.

1039
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,041
Okay, time out.

1040
01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:09,375
So I'm using every free hour I have,

1041
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:11,583
practicing into the night
for this competition

1042
01:02:11,666 --> 01:02:13,208
that you asked me to help you with,

1043
01:02:13,291 --> 01:02:15,208
just so I could screw things up for you?

1044
01:02:19,666 --> 01:02:20,500
No.

1045
01:02:23,583 --> 01:02:24,500
No, I'm sorry.

1046
01:02:27,083 --> 01:02:29,375
I'm just kinda going through some stuff
right now.

1047
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:35,166
Look, you have to trust me.

1048
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:39,166
If we can't have fun, it's gonna show
in our scores with the judges.

1049
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:40,208
I'm having fun.

1050
01:02:42,416 --> 01:02:43,625
Sure about that?

1051
01:02:44,875 --> 01:02:46,666
Watch yourself. I recorded us.

1052
01:02:48,125 --> 01:02:50,166
Here.

1053
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:54,291
Oh, my God.

1054
01:02:55,166 --> 01:02:57,291
You're just thinking too much.

1055
01:02:57,375 --> 01:03:00,250
You just gotta let go, feel the music.

1056
01:03:03,916 --> 01:03:06,041
Why did you and Lee start doing this
in the first place?

1057
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,250
'Cause it was fun.

1058
01:03:16,416 --> 01:03:18,666
I'm sorry I've been giving you
so much shit.

1059
01:03:19,083 --> 01:03:20,583
Ah, it's okay.

1060
01:03:21,708 --> 01:03:23,916
I'm starting to think I really need
to work on my footwork.

1061
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,833
- Shut up!
- Look at this!

1062
01:03:28,916 --> 01:03:29,750
You hungry?

1063
01:03:32,083 --> 01:03:34,458
- I'm so glad we took a break.
- Yeah, for once.

1064
01:03:34,583 --> 01:03:38,916
- I can be a little obsessive.
- You put a lot of pressure on yourself.

1065
01:03:40,208 --> 01:03:42,458
Yeah, well how else
are you gonna get what you want?

1066
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,416
I don't know.

1067
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:47,458
I don't like making plans.
I just kinda roll with things.

1068
01:03:48,583 --> 01:03:49,500
Yeah, but...

1069
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,166
what do you wanna do?

1070
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:54,041
Not sure.

1071
01:03:55,333 --> 01:03:57,375
Be happy, I guess.

1072
01:04:01,208 --> 01:04:05,291
But I gotta say, you inspire me.

1073
01:04:06,125 --> 01:04:06,958
Me?

1074
01:04:07,583 --> 01:04:09,125
You know what you want,
and you go after it.

1075
01:04:09,208 --> 01:04:10,041
No.

1076
01:04:10,166 --> 01:04:12,458
No, no.
That is the wrong impression of me.

1077
01:04:12,541 --> 01:04:14,291
I have no idea what I want to do
with my life.

1078
01:04:14,375 --> 01:04:15,833
You make things happen.

1079
01:04:17,875 --> 01:04:18,791
I admire it.

1080
01:04:21,375 --> 01:04:23,250
Well, I was gonna say that I...

1081
01:04:24,541 --> 01:04:26,583
admire <i>you</i> for just wanting to be happy.

1082
01:04:32,291 --> 01:04:34,625
I really am grateful for your help,
by the way.

1083
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:38,833
I'm not exactly rich,
so this is is kinda like my moonshot

1084
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:41,083
to pick where I wanna go to school.

1085
01:04:42,166 --> 01:04:43,000
What do you mean?

1086
01:04:44,708 --> 01:04:47,708
It's like something amazing
that you want really badly,

1087
01:04:47,791 --> 01:04:49,666
but it's not super likely to happen.

1088
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:51,833
Like winning the DDM tournament.

1089
01:04:52,583 --> 01:04:53,500
No pressure.

1090
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:55,333
Hmm.

1091
01:04:56,208 --> 01:04:57,083
"Moonshot."

1092
01:04:58,291 --> 01:04:59,625
Feels like pressure.

1093
01:04:59,708 --> 01:05:03,291
Actually, it is. Yeah. Tons of pressure.

1094
01:05:10,541 --> 01:05:14,041
So... Noah's in Boston and...

1095
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,250
and I mean...

1096
01:05:18,583 --> 01:05:22,125
I don't need to get into all the details,
but there's this girl...

1097
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:24,416
And you think he's involved with her?

1098
01:05:24,833 --> 01:05:26,250
I don't know. I mean...

1099
01:05:27,291 --> 01:05:28,750
I mean, he says he's not.

1100
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:34,916
It's funny 'cause when he left,
I kinda had just assumed

1101
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,666
that he would meet someone else

1102
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:39,208
and then it would just be over for us,
you know?

1103
01:05:41,875 --> 01:05:44,166
Do you think
you and Noah were meant to be together?

1104
01:05:47,625 --> 01:05:48,958
I always thought we were.

1105
01:05:50,125 --> 01:05:51,416
But now...

1106
01:05:53,333 --> 01:05:54,166
I don't know.

1107
01:05:57,208 --> 01:05:59,833
It's like I'm trying so hard
to hold on to this...

1108
01:06:00,875 --> 01:06:03,875
thing, and it just feels
like it's slipping away.

1109
01:06:10,375 --> 01:06:11,500
I don't know Flynn,

1110
01:06:12,958 --> 01:06:15,166
but if I found someone who I loved,

1111
01:06:16,208 --> 01:06:19,083
that was smart and funny

1112
01:06:19,791 --> 01:06:21,458
and liked the same stuff I liked,

1113
01:06:23,708 --> 01:06:25,500
I'd never make her feel like that.

1114
01:06:28,125 --> 01:06:29,708
Wouldn't let her get away, huh?

1115
01:06:30,875 --> 01:06:32,458
I don't see it like that.

1116
01:06:33,083 --> 01:06:34,958
You can't really hold on to someone.

1117
01:06:36,083 --> 01:06:39,833
'Cause the tighter you hold on to them,
the more they wanna slip away.

1118
01:06:40,833 --> 01:06:42,333
All you can do is love them...

1119
01:06:43,375 --> 01:06:47,041
and make sure they know
that you're never gonna slip away.

1120
01:06:51,708 --> 01:06:54,458
Uh, I don't know
if I'm saying that right.

1121
01:06:54,541 --> 01:06:57,500
No, you're... saying it perfectly.

1122
01:07:03,375 --> 01:07:05,791
So are you gonna go
to the Halloween dance?

1123
01:07:05,875 --> 01:07:06,833
I don't know yet.

1124
01:07:07,583 --> 01:07:11,291
- Oh, right. Sorry, no plans. My bad.
- Exactly.

1125
01:08:02,208 --> 01:08:05,666
<i>Expectations make it difficult</i>
<i>to figure out what you want to be,</i>

1126
01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:09,416
<i>because whether it's something
you thought you'd be doing...</i>

1127
01:08:15,375 --> 01:08:18,458
<i>Or someone you thought you knew.</i>

1128
01:08:19,375 --> 01:08:20,208
Hey.

1129
01:08:20,291 --> 01:08:22,708
Hey, listen, I'm sorry I didn't get
to call you last night.

1130
01:08:22,791 --> 01:08:24,958
I went out,
and I just left my phone at home.

1131
01:08:25,458 --> 01:08:27,958
That's okay. Uh, did you have fun?

1132
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:31,083
Yeah, it was nice.
We saw this pretty great band.

1133
01:08:31,166 --> 01:08:32,041
<i>It was great.</i>

1134
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:33,208
Cool.

1135
01:08:35,083 --> 01:08:36,250
Uh, who'd you go with?

1136
01:08:39,083 --> 01:08:40,416
Uh, just some of the guys.

1137
01:08:42,708 --> 01:08:43,625
Oh, um...

1138
01:08:44,208 --> 01:08:46,208
<i>The difference
from what you expected</i>

1139
01:08:46,291 --> 01:08:47,500
<i>to what actually happens...</i>

1140
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:50,916
Sounds like a lot of fun.

1141
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:53,583
Yeah.

1142
01:08:54,083 --> 01:08:57,625
<i>Can make you look at the future
in a very different way.</i>

1143
01:09:01,916 --> 01:09:03,291
Check it out!

1144
01:09:03,375 --> 01:09:04,541
What do you think?

1145
01:09:04,625 --> 01:09:07,166
- What? That's so unfair!
- Oh!

1146
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:09,333
- I didn't know we were, like, doing...
- Hi, Elle.

1147
01:09:09,416 --> 01:09:11,000
Oh, hey! How's it going?

1148
01:09:11,083 --> 01:09:13,458
Look at my stupid pumpkin,
compared to his.

1149
01:09:13,958 --> 01:09:16,750
Lee, I thought we were carving pumpkins
today together.

1150
01:09:16,833 --> 01:09:18,083
I can't even make this better.

1151
01:09:18,166 --> 01:09:20,916
Ah, yeah, sorry.
Elle and I kinda got carried away.

1152
01:09:21,875 --> 01:09:25,541
Okay, well, I guess we can just go, then.

1153
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:27,500
Cool, where we all going?

1154
01:09:28,375 --> 01:09:29,250
Uh...

1155
01:09:34,458 --> 01:09:36,291
Hey, Lee, let's go for a walk.

1156
01:09:36,416 --> 01:09:37,750
Okay, yeah. I'd love to.

1157
01:09:37,833 --> 01:09:40,208
Yeah! It'll be fun!

1158
01:09:51,958 --> 01:09:52,791
How's it going?

1159
01:09:54,125 --> 01:09:55,375
Oh, yeah, good.

1160
01:09:57,708 --> 01:09:58,541
Really?

1161
01:09:59,833 --> 01:10:00,708
Yeah.

1162
01:10:01,166 --> 01:10:02,291
Why? What do you mean?

1163
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:06,041
Well, I hope you don't mind me asking,
but, um...

1164
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:09,500
What's going on with you and Miles?

1165
01:10:10,166 --> 01:10:12,291
What do you mean?
There's nothing going on!

1166
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:15,041
Oh! Okay, sorry. My bad.

1167
01:10:20,333 --> 01:10:21,833
Hey, I'm sorry.

1168
01:10:22,958 --> 01:10:25,208
No, no, I was wrong.
It's none of my business.

1169
01:10:25,291 --> 01:10:26,125
Yeah, but...

1170
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
you're not wrong.

1171
01:10:33,541 --> 01:10:34,666
So you're into him?

1172
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:37,291
I don't know. I don't know what I am.
I just...

1173
01:10:38,708 --> 01:10:39,750
I like him.

1174
01:10:41,916 --> 01:10:44,583
I'm not even sure why.
I mean, look at him. He's like...

1175
01:10:45,916 --> 01:10:46,750
Oof!

1176
01:10:46,833 --> 01:10:48,333
He's a total dork, right?

1177
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:52,166
I don't know. He's kind of adorable.

1178
01:10:52,791 --> 01:10:54,083
And he's really smart.

1179
01:10:57,708 --> 01:10:59,708
And those dimples definitely don't hurt.

1180
01:11:00,583 --> 01:11:01,958
Yeah.

1181
01:11:03,583 --> 01:11:04,958
So what are you gonna do?

1182
01:11:06,708 --> 01:11:07,958
Nothing, probably.

1183
01:11:09,083 --> 01:11:10,833
Please don't say anything to anybody.

1184
01:11:11,375 --> 01:11:12,625
I would never, no.

1185
01:11:13,791 --> 01:11:14,666
But, Ollie,

1186
01:11:15,583 --> 01:11:17,583
you really shouldn't care
what the guys think.

1187
01:11:18,208 --> 01:11:20,333
And you definitely
shouldn't let it stop you

1188
01:11:20,416 --> 01:11:22,375
from being with someone that you like.

1189
01:11:23,208 --> 01:11:28,000
Believe me,
I know all about that, and it sucks.

1190
01:11:52,125 --> 01:11:55,041
Whoo! Saved the city. Boom.
That's why we're here.

1191
01:11:55,125 --> 01:11:57,041
- Whoo!
- Ay-yi-yi!

1192
01:11:57,125 --> 01:11:58,333
Oh, no!

1193
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,041
Oh, shit!

1194
01:12:00,125 --> 01:12:02,708
- Lee, you didn't tell her?
- I totally forgot!

1195
01:12:03,166 --> 01:12:05,833
Rach, I'm so sorry, I forgot to tell you
we changed our outfits!

1196
01:12:05,916 --> 01:12:07,541
- It's fine.
<i>- Yikes!</i>

1197
01:12:57,083 --> 01:12:59,291
Thank you!

1198
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:07,541
Well, well, well.

1199
01:13:08,291 --> 01:13:10,833
This is a little bit more
than "maybe I'll show up."

1200
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:14,041
Ah, they called me last night to see
if I could cover for lead guitar.

1201
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:17,458
But since we're both here...

1202
01:13:19,083 --> 01:13:20,375
would you like to dance?

1203
01:13:21,208 --> 01:13:22,083
Um...

1204
01:13:24,291 --> 01:13:26,125
Yeah, that would be really nice.

1205
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:40,000
She has a boyfriend.

1206
01:13:40,125 --> 01:13:41,750
- He is fine.
- Well, yeah.

1207
01:13:43,041 --> 01:13:45,041
Just let go, feel the music.

1208
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,833
I guess she got over Flynn.

1209
01:14:37,583 --> 01:14:38,458
Um...

1210
01:14:40,916 --> 01:14:43,208
What are we doing?
We dance all the time, right?

1211
01:14:45,708 --> 01:14:49,750
- Oh.
- Yeah, no worries, I understand.

1212
01:14:51,625 --> 01:14:53,375
I'm just gonna hop back in then.

1213
01:14:54,833 --> 01:14:55,666
Okay.

1214
01:15:03,375 --> 01:15:04,500
Bye!

1215
01:15:12,416 --> 01:15:13,250
Hey.

1216
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:14,625
Hi.

1217
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:17,083
Nice costume.

1218
01:15:18,125 --> 01:15:18,958
You too.

1219
01:15:19,625 --> 01:15:21,416
Thanks.

1220
01:15:21,541 --> 01:15:22,791
Um...

1221
01:15:27,375 --> 01:15:29,666
So, I was thinking,

1222
01:15:30,208 --> 01:15:32,416
maybe you and I could...

1223
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:35,583
- Whoo! Hey, dude.
- Hey, dudes!

1224
01:15:35,666 --> 01:15:38,958
- What's going on?
- Uh, nothing, we're just chillin'.

1225
01:15:39,041 --> 01:15:41,958
- Oh.
- Anyway, I will see you later, Miles.

1226
01:15:42,041 --> 01:15:43,958
- Okay.
- Yeah. Let's go, boys.

1227
01:15:44,041 --> 01:15:45,250
Yeah. See ya.

1228
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:47,416
Bye, guys.

1229
01:15:53,375 --> 01:15:55,541
Oh! This is my jam! Okay!

1230
01:15:56,291 --> 01:15:59,541
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1231
01:16:42,666 --> 01:16:44,666
Oh, that was awesome. Whoo!

1232
01:16:45,166 --> 01:16:47,375
Hey, what's up with Rachel?

1233
01:16:48,125 --> 01:16:51,375
- She must still be upset.
- Let me. Let me try.

1234
01:16:53,791 --> 01:16:54,666
Hey.

1235
01:16:57,541 --> 01:16:59,833
- What's going on?
- I'm not in the mood, Elle.

1236
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:04,791
Rachel, I'm really, really sorry
about the costume mix-up.

1237
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:06,916
I had Lee switch it at the very last...

1238
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,833
You just couldn't do as you were asked,
could you?

1239
01:17:10,333 --> 01:17:12,000
What? Rachel.

1240
01:17:13,291 --> 01:17:16,333
I'm sorry. Rachel, I don't really know
what you're talking about.

1241
01:17:16,416 --> 01:17:17,750
- Did I do something?
- Something?

1242
01:17:18,416 --> 01:17:20,000
Did you do <i>some thing?</i>

1243
01:17:20,416 --> 01:17:23,041
You crashed my prom.
You ruined bowling nights.

1244
01:17:23,125 --> 01:17:26,166
You wasted all of Lee's time
with your stupid dance game.

1245
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:27,708
My God, Elle, with you around,

1246
01:17:27,791 --> 01:17:31,625
I literally can't spend a moment alone
with my own boyfriend!

1247
01:17:34,041 --> 01:17:37,250
Rachel, I had no idea
that you were feeling this way...

1248
01:17:37,333 --> 01:17:40,666
How can you stand there and say that
when we both know it's a lie?

1249
01:17:41,666 --> 01:17:44,666
I'm leaving now, and I'm going to my house
because that's the only way

1250
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:46,291
that I can spend time with Lee...

1251
01:17:46,375 --> 01:17:47,333
- Rachel.
- Without you!

1252
01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:50,708
Rachel...

1253
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:53,625
And I never wanted to be
a friggin' marshmallow in the first place!

1254
01:17:57,291 --> 01:17:59,916
- What happened?
- Lee, are you coming?

1255
01:18:01,083 --> 01:18:03,958
Go, go, go. I'll find a ride...

1256
01:18:06,416 --> 01:18:07,250
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

1257
01:18:34,916 --> 01:18:35,833
Hey.

1258
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,916
Sorry, I gotta stop here.
You are a good-looking couple.

1259
01:19:35,291 --> 01:19:38,916
You look like Justin Bieber
before he started being a trucker.

1260
01:19:42,166 --> 01:19:43,250
Want some company?

1261
01:19:45,791 --> 01:19:46,625
Sure.

1262
01:20:25,833 --> 01:20:27,541
- Get out of here!
- Hey!

1263
01:20:28,041 --> 01:20:29,250
Agghh!

1264
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:36,958
I'll be right back, class.

1265
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,583
<i>Like I said,</i>
<i>I knew I'd come to regret this,</i>

1266
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,708
<i>but once you start,</i>

1267
01:20:57,708 --> 01:20:59,500
<i>it's really hard to stop.</i>

1268
01:21:25,708 --> 01:21:27,458
<i>That moment when your heart sinks,</i>

1269
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,833
<i>this is what it looked like for me.</i>

1270
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,583
So, last rehearsal before the big day.

1271
01:21:40,458 --> 01:21:41,458
How you feeling?

1272
01:21:42,125 --> 01:21:42,958
Yeah, good.

1273
01:21:45,375 --> 01:21:47,458
You sure? You seem a little off.

1274
01:21:48,208 --> 01:21:49,916
I'm fine. Let's just rehearse, okay?

1275
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:51,666
Hey. Hey.

1276
01:21:53,166 --> 01:21:54,041
Look at me.

1277
01:21:57,833 --> 01:22:00,125
Just let go, feel the music.

1278
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:02,416
All right?

1279
01:22:03,208 --> 01:22:04,041
Right.

1280
01:22:10,375 --> 01:22:14,000
Just let go.

1281
01:22:24,708 --> 01:22:26,250
<i>Just let go...</i>

1282
01:22:37,541 --> 01:22:39,750
<i>Just let go...</i>

1283
01:22:40,625 --> 01:22:41,708
I believe you.

1284
01:22:42,083 --> 01:22:46,041
<i>We're less interested in meeting</i>
<i>the person you think we want you to be</i>

1285
01:22:46,125 --> 01:22:50,666
and far more interested in getting to know
the person you really are.

1286
01:22:50,958 --> 01:22:51,958
<i>Let go!</i>

1287
01:23:47,166 --> 01:23:48,791
Okay, yeah, I think we got it.

1288
01:23:56,958 --> 01:23:58,708
I should probably get going.

1289
01:24:00,375 --> 01:24:01,208
Elle...

1290
01:24:04,791 --> 01:24:05,875
your shoe's untied.

1291
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:15,250
I'll see you tomorrow.

1292
01:24:16,333 --> 01:24:17,250
See you tomorrow.

1293
01:24:22,458 --> 01:24:23,333
Moonshot.

1294
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:36,791
- Hello?
- Hey.

1295
01:24:40,958 --> 01:24:42,125
Is everything okay?

1296
01:24:44,583 --> 01:24:48,208
Yeah, um, just tired.
We've been rehearsing.

1297
01:24:48,291 --> 01:24:51,875
Okay, well, I just wanted to wish you luck
for your competition tomorrow.

1298
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:55,458
You remembered.

1299
01:24:55,625 --> 01:24:57,208
Yeah, of course I remembered.

1300
01:24:57,708 --> 01:24:58,833
<i>I wish I could be there.</i>

1301
01:25:00,166 --> 01:25:03,000
<i>Elle, I know that, um...
That you and I have some things</i>

1302
01:25:03,083 --> 01:25:06,750
that we need to talk about,
but I'd rather do it face-to-face.

1303
01:25:07,166 --> 01:25:09,833
So I'm gonna be home
the day after tomorrow for Thanksgiving,

1304
01:25:09,916 --> 01:25:13,166
and I guess we can talk about it all then.

1305
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,333
<i>Okay?</i>

1306
01:25:15,625 --> 01:25:16,916
<i>Noah was right.</i>

1307
01:25:17,291 --> 01:25:19,625
<i>Some things just need to be said
in person.</i>

1308
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:22,250
Okay.

1309
01:25:31,833 --> 01:25:35,833
<i>Welcome to the West Coast</i>
<i>Dance Dance Mania ultimate showdown.</i>

1310
01:25:35,916 --> 01:25:37,958
There's a lot of people here,
a lot of people to watch.

1311
01:25:38,041 --> 01:25:39,000
- Sign in.
- Sign in?

1312
01:25:39,083 --> 01:25:40,916
Yeah, sign in's over there. Thank you.

1313
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,833
Look at the judges here!

1314
01:25:43,416 --> 01:25:44,375
It's Lee.

1315
01:25:50,333 --> 01:25:52,125
- You ready?
- Whoo! Okay.

1316
01:26:36,916 --> 01:26:38,791
- They're really good.
- Yeah.

1317
01:26:49,583 --> 01:26:50,416
Wow.

1318
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:52,041
Love their costumes too.

1319
01:27:05,458 --> 01:27:06,791
Wow, they came to win.

1320
01:27:08,625 --> 01:27:10,375
Okay, Evans, Peña.

1321
01:27:10,875 --> 01:27:11,916
You're up next.

1322
01:27:12,291 --> 01:27:13,291
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

1323
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:21,041
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1324
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,041
What the hell?

1325
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,250
Just have fun.

1326
01:29:05,375 --> 01:29:07,125
- Hey, you wanna have some fun?
- You sure?

1327
01:29:07,208 --> 01:29:08,125
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1328
01:29:09,333 --> 01:29:10,750
- Let's do it.
- Get ready.

1329
01:30:35,916 --> 01:30:36,916
Oh, my God! Look!

1330
01:30:41,583 --> 01:30:44,291
Hello! I'm Toni.
I'm one of your judges tonight

1331
01:30:44,375 --> 01:30:46,833
and a professor
at the University of Southern California's

1332
01:30:46,916 --> 01:30:49,833
Interactive Media
and Video Gaming Department.

1333
01:30:49,916 --> 01:30:53,166
It's so exciting to be a part of the event
this year.

1334
01:30:53,625 --> 01:30:56,375
This has been
our fiercest competition yet.

1335
01:30:57,041 --> 01:31:01,416
I'm proud to announce that this year's
winners of the DDM West Coast Jam are...

1336
01:31:02,291 --> 01:31:03,958
Drum roll, please.

1337
01:31:05,083 --> 01:31:07,208
Elle Evans and Marco Peña!

1338
01:31:21,416 --> 01:31:22,791
<i>Anyone trying to figure out</i>

1339
01:31:22,875 --> 01:31:26,458
<i>what they'll be in five years confronts
one undeniable fact.</i>

1340
01:31:27,291 --> 01:31:29,166
<i>Just as a great writer once said,</i>

1341
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:31,666
<i>"Perhaps the Earth was made round</i>

1342
01:31:32,083 --> 01:31:34,625
<i>so that we would not see
too far down the road."</i>

1343
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:39,875
<i>We set out on journeys full of hopes
and expectations, but when we arrive,</i>

1344
01:31:39,958 --> 01:31:44,041
<i>the destination never ends up looking
exactly the way we had hoped it would.</i>

1345
01:31:44,125 --> 01:31:46,333
Elle, wait. Please, stop!

1346
01:31:47,416 --> 01:31:51,333
I'm sorry, but I just can't deal
with this right now.

1347
01:31:51,416 --> 01:31:53,583
So you're just gonna ignore
what's happening between us?

1348
01:31:53,666 --> 01:31:56,125
I'm really sorry. Can we just please
talk about this later? Please.

1349
01:32:01,833 --> 01:32:02,958
Congratulations.

1350
01:32:07,083 --> 01:32:09,916
<i>The next day,</i>
<i>Noah still wasn't answering my texts.</i>

1351
01:32:11,583 --> 01:32:13,958
<i>And for some reason, neither was Lee.</i>

1352
01:32:15,083 --> 01:32:18,708
- Hey! The Evans clan arrives!
- Hi!

1353
01:32:18,791 --> 01:32:20,875
<i>Hopefully,</i>
<i>Thanksgiving dinner at the Flynns</i>

1354
01:32:20,958 --> 01:32:22,500
<i>would take care of both problems.</i>

1355
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:29,541
Wait! Rachel!

1356
01:32:31,083 --> 01:32:32,666
Rachel, I've been trying to text you!

1357
01:32:32,750 --> 01:32:34,375
Elle, I'm not in the mood.

1358
01:32:34,458 --> 01:32:36,458
- I know that you're upset, but...
- Seriously, Elle.

1359
01:32:37,583 --> 01:32:40,291
Seriously, can you just talk to me?
Like, I don't know what's going on.

1360
01:32:40,375 --> 01:32:42,875
- Happy Thanksgiving, y'all.
- Happy Thanksgiving, Lee!

1361
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,708
Dude, what the hell?
Rachel's still so pissed at me.

1362
01:32:46,791 --> 01:32:48,333
Yeah, well, that would make two of us.

1363
01:32:48,958 --> 01:32:49,958
Why are you mad?

1364
01:32:50,041 --> 01:32:52,750
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe the answer is in here.

1365
01:32:56,541 --> 01:32:57,666
Shit!

1366
01:32:57,833 --> 01:32:59,750
Gosh, wait, Lee. Listen to me. I'm...

1367
01:32:59,833 --> 01:33:01,833
- We're back!
- Hey!

1368
01:33:01,916 --> 01:33:05,375
- Ah, Chloe! Good to finally meet you.
- Well, it's lovely to meet you too.

1369
01:33:05,458 --> 01:33:07,541
- Yeah. Come inside.
- Ooh! Wow.

1370
01:33:08,041 --> 01:33:09,750
Oh, and Elle, you are here!

1371
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:12,541
Yeah, and so are you.

1372
01:33:12,625 --> 01:33:14,625
Noah said he wasn't sure
that you would be.

1373
01:33:15,375 --> 01:33:17,000
Really? Is that what he said?

1374
01:33:17,083 --> 01:33:18,000
Dinner's ready!

1375
01:33:28,708 --> 01:33:29,791
Careful with those yams.

1376
01:33:31,166 --> 01:33:33,833
You're can get drunk off those.

1377
01:33:33,916 --> 01:33:35,875
Lee, do you wanna go talk for a second?

1378
01:33:36,333 --> 01:33:37,208
Not really, no.

1379
01:33:37,291 --> 01:33:38,541
Can we please just go talk?

1380
01:33:38,625 --> 01:33:41,791
Talking. I always feel like talking's
better when it's face-to-face.

1381
01:33:41,916 --> 01:33:44,333
- Lee.
- So, Chloe, I hear Boston sucks.

1382
01:33:44,416 --> 01:33:46,458
I'm not really sure how to answer that.

1383
01:33:46,541 --> 01:33:49,125
It's fine if that's where people want
to live, but you shouldn't lie about it.

1384
01:33:49,208 --> 01:33:53,041
Lying. Lying is an interesting topic
of conversation.

1385
01:33:53,125 --> 01:33:55,583
Of course, people aren't always
making decisions alone.

1386
01:33:55,666 --> 01:33:58,583
You know, sometimes they need convincing
to do the really stupid shit.

1387
01:33:58,666 --> 01:34:00,166
- Lee!
- You need to shut your mouth.

1388
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:02,041
You need to leave Lee out of this.

1389
01:34:02,125 --> 01:34:04,541
Why are you acting like I'm the one
that did something wrong?

1390
01:34:04,625 --> 01:34:06,375
Noah, you...

1391
01:34:06,916 --> 01:34:08,583
you don't wanna go there right now.

1392
01:34:09,833 --> 01:34:11,000
And, Lee, listen.

1393
01:34:11,083 --> 01:34:14,833
I am actually really sorry about applying
to schools in Boston, and, Rachel,

1394
01:34:14,916 --> 01:34:16,875
I don't even know
why you're mad at me right now.

1395
01:34:17,333 --> 01:34:20,208
So you're just gonna pretend
that Lee never told you

1396
01:34:20,291 --> 01:34:23,458
that we needed space
from you constantly hanging around us?

1397
01:34:24,750 --> 01:34:25,583
What?

1398
01:34:29,541 --> 01:34:30,708
Lee, you never...

1399
01:34:32,583 --> 01:34:35,333
- Lee, you never said that.
- Yes, he did! Lee, tell her.

1400
01:34:47,875 --> 01:34:49,458
I tried to, but...

1401
01:34:52,958 --> 01:34:54,916
Rach. Rach.

1402
01:34:58,083 --> 01:34:59,458
- Oh, my... I am so...
- Rach.

1403
01:34:59,541 --> 01:35:01,875
Thank you for the invitation. I just...

1404
01:35:01,958 --> 01:35:03,500
- Rachel.
- Rachel.

1405
01:35:04,833 --> 01:35:05,666
Rachel.

1406
01:35:08,833 --> 01:35:10,833
Rachel. Rachel, please!

1407
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:14,375
She's my best friend.

1408
01:35:14,458 --> 01:35:15,750
You lied to me!

1409
01:35:16,333 --> 01:35:19,333
And you let me say all
of those horrible things to her.

1410
01:35:20,541 --> 01:35:24,000
I heard what you said
at your birthday party when Elle ran out.

1411
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,250
<i>Elle, what's wrong?</i>

1412
01:35:26,625 --> 01:35:27,958
I followed you two.

1413
01:35:28,041 --> 01:35:29,875
<i>I love you.</i>

1414
01:35:30,625 --> 01:35:32,750
But being my best friend

1415
01:35:33,083 --> 01:35:36,541
doesn't give you the right to tell me
who I can love.

1416
01:35:37,333 --> 01:35:38,791
It's like with Rachel.

1417
01:35:38,875 --> 01:35:41,833
What if I didn't like having her around?
What would you do then?

1418
01:35:42,625 --> 01:35:45,083
- I guess I'd break up with her.
- No, you see,

1419
01:35:45,208 --> 01:35:46,541
you shouldn't have to do that

1420
01:35:46,625 --> 01:35:48,833
<i>just because I didn't want you
to be with her.</i>

1421
01:35:48,916 --> 01:35:50,958
But you don't have to break up with me

1422
01:35:51,833 --> 01:35:55,750
because I can't be in a relationship
with you and Elle anymore.

1423
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:57,125
It's just too much.

1424
01:36:00,541 --> 01:36:03,583
Rachel.

1425
01:36:03,708 --> 01:36:07,083
I am grateful for family,

1426
01:36:09,875 --> 01:36:10,875
uh...

1427
01:36:11,333 --> 01:36:12,208
my new friend,

1428
01:36:13,458 --> 01:36:14,541
and...

1429
01:36:15,208 --> 01:36:16,458
my motorcycle.

1430
01:36:20,166 --> 01:36:22,666
Um, okay. Elle...

1431
01:36:23,791 --> 01:36:24,833
Oh.

1432
01:36:25,208 --> 01:36:26,708
Wow, what a tough act to follow.

1433
01:36:27,291 --> 01:36:28,125
Let's see.

1434
01:36:28,541 --> 01:36:30,791
I'm thankful for my family,

1435
01:36:31,458 --> 01:36:34,375
for that I just, you know,
won some money for school,

1436
01:36:34,791 --> 01:36:36,791
and... oh, yeah, oh, my God,

1437
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:38,750
I am super-duper thankful

1438
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:41,791
that, um, that I found Chloe's earring.

1439
01:36:42,791 --> 01:36:44,958
Oh, my God. Where did you find it?

1440
01:36:49,041 --> 01:36:50,250
Under Noah's bed.

1441
01:36:54,291 --> 01:36:57,833
But what I'm most thankful for is
that I found the earring...

1442
01:36:59,666 --> 01:37:03,875
before I did anything crazy,
like rearrange my whole life for someone.

1443
01:37:09,833 --> 01:37:13,000
You know, it kind of looked to me
like you'd already rearranged your life.

1444
01:37:18,416 --> 01:37:19,916
I think that maybe we should just...

1445
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,291
You know what? This has been lovely.
Chloe, always a pleasure,

1446
01:37:23,375 --> 01:37:25,458
but I think it's time
for me to head out too. So...

1447
01:37:26,875 --> 01:37:27,708
Elle.

1448
01:37:30,375 --> 01:37:31,458
Where are you going?

1449
01:37:33,041 --> 01:37:36,458
To fix something
that's actually worth saving.

1450
01:37:46,916 --> 01:37:50,333
And with Noah gone,
I was just... lonely, you know?

1451
01:37:50,416 --> 01:37:53,333
- I didn't realize that I was even...
- Cock-blocking?

1452
01:37:55,208 --> 01:37:59,250
Not sure if I would have phrased it
like that, but, yeah, I guess.

1453
01:38:00,916 --> 01:38:04,416
The idea that I had something to do
with you guys breaking up,

1454
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:06,750
- I feel so...
- No. Lee did this.

1455
01:38:07,333 --> 01:38:11,291
And he'd do it again
because that's how much you mean to him.

1456
01:38:11,375 --> 01:38:13,500
Rachel, he loves you so much.

1457
01:38:13,625 --> 01:38:15,041
And now that I know the problem,

1458
01:38:15,125 --> 01:38:16,666
- I can absolutely fix...
- Elle!

1459
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:20,625
It's rule number 16.

1460
01:38:24,125 --> 01:38:24,958
You know?

1461
01:38:26,791 --> 01:38:30,000
{\an8}<i>Rule number 16: when
your bestie needs you there,</i>

1462
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:32,541
{\an8}<i>you need to be there for your bestie.</i>

1463
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:35,166
You know what I can't figure out though?

1464
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:38,500
How did your earring get under my bed
in the first place?

1465
01:38:39,916 --> 01:38:41,708
Okay, about that...

1466
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:44,041
Um, don't get pissy,

1467
01:38:44,708 --> 01:38:48,208
but when you were out of town
for a football game, I...

1468
01:38:48,708 --> 01:38:51,916
sort of crashed at your place
after getting into a fight with Jason

1469
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,541
and the earring must have
just fallen off then.

1470
01:38:54,625 --> 01:38:56,250
Why wouldn't you tell me that?

1471
01:38:56,333 --> 01:38:57,916
- That's just...
- I said <i>don't </i>get pissy.

1472
01:38:58,625 --> 01:39:01,000
Now that we know what's happened,
we can fix this.

1473
01:39:02,166 --> 01:39:03,958
Yeah, I'm not sure if I wanna fix it.

1474
01:39:06,291 --> 01:39:08,833
You know,
I can't stop thinking about that kiss.

1475
01:39:09,875 --> 01:39:12,875
I can't believe that she thought
that I'd actually cheat on her, you know?

1476
01:39:13,333 --> 01:39:16,041
That's the reason I was lying
about us hanging out in the first place.

1477
01:39:16,125 --> 01:39:18,250
I was trying to avoid
this whole situation.

1478
01:39:18,791 --> 01:39:19,833
Listen to me.

1479
01:39:20,875 --> 01:39:23,333
Just to give you things
from Elle's point of view,

1480
01:39:23,750 --> 01:39:27,458
you used to have
quite the reputation, right?

1481
01:39:28,166 --> 01:39:32,250
And Elle has no idea that I am one
of the few women on the planet

1482
01:39:32,791 --> 01:39:35,708
immune to the charms of Noah Flynn.

1483
01:39:37,083 --> 01:39:40,083
And then she finds my earring,
which couldn't have been very helpful

1484
01:39:40,166 --> 01:39:41,875
to a woman who's missing her guy

1485
01:39:41,958 --> 01:39:44,250
all the way on the other side
of the country.

1486
01:39:47,666 --> 01:39:48,833
I don't like it when you're right.

1487
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:52,833
Well, I do sleep where I'm not supposed to
from time to time,

1488
01:39:52,916 --> 01:39:54,291
but overall,

1489
01:39:56,458 --> 01:39:57,666
I'm a very talented individual.

1490
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,958
<i>I think I know where Lee is.</i>

1491
01:40:09,083 --> 01:40:11,958
- Can I help you before I go? Just...
- No, no, no.

1492
01:40:12,041 --> 01:40:13,250
I'll take care of this mess.

1493
01:40:13,666 --> 01:40:15,333
You go take care of yours.

1494
01:40:16,041 --> 01:40:19,291
But, Elle, before you go,
I just want to say this afternoon,

1495
01:40:19,375 --> 01:40:22,250
I noticed the three of you doing
a lot of talking

1496
01:40:22,666 --> 01:40:24,458
and maybe not as much listening.

1497
01:40:25,083 --> 01:40:26,708
I just want to tell you make sure

1498
01:40:26,791 --> 01:40:29,458
that you really listen
to what the other person has to say.

1499
01:40:30,041 --> 01:40:31,833
Just hear them out, okay?

1500
01:40:32,833 --> 01:40:33,916
Okay.

1501
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:34,833
Okay.

1502
01:40:36,125 --> 01:40:37,208
Oh! I almost forgot.

1503
01:40:38,125 --> 01:40:40,958
There's a thing I wanna take with me.

1504
01:40:55,250 --> 01:40:56,583
<i>Rule number 19.</i>

1505
01:40:57,083 --> 01:40:59,291
You should have told me
about applying to Harvard.

1506
01:40:59,375 --> 01:41:00,208
I know.

1507
01:41:02,166 --> 01:41:04,166
- I'm sorry.
- I thought you wanted to go to Berkeley.

1508
01:41:04,250 --> 01:41:05,458
I do.

1509
01:41:05,916 --> 01:41:07,416
It's just...

1510
01:41:07,541 --> 01:41:11,791
Like, being away from Noah was so much
harder than I thought it was gonna be.

1511
01:41:13,541 --> 01:41:16,083
And you should have told me
about how Rachel was feeling.

1512
01:41:17,708 --> 01:41:19,583
I was going to, but I just...

1513
01:41:20,041 --> 01:41:22,000
saw how lonely you were when Noah left.

1514
01:41:22,083 --> 01:41:23,958
You know that I would have understood.

1515
01:41:26,125 --> 01:41:29,958
Well, I guess the real reason
I didn't tell you was...

1516
01:41:31,958 --> 01:41:33,500
because I didn't want to.

1517
01:41:33,958 --> 01:41:36,625
I just always want you around.

1518
01:41:37,041 --> 01:41:40,666
- Lee.
- But then I couldn't say no to Rachel,

1519
01:41:41,125 --> 01:41:44,375
pretended to hurt myself so that you'd be
busy practicing with Marco,

1520
01:41:44,458 --> 01:41:46,750
and then I would have time to hang out
with Rachel.

1521
01:41:46,833 --> 01:41:47,791
Just... God!

1522
01:41:48,916 --> 01:41:50,791
Now you know how I felt last year.

1523
01:41:51,791 --> 01:41:53,375
I didn't want to choose either,

1524
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:56,166
but I had to make a choice.

1525
01:42:00,583 --> 01:42:02,333
Hey, one more thing.

1526
01:42:04,625 --> 01:42:05,791
Rule number 5.

1527
01:42:07,083 --> 01:42:09,000
You did not bring it with you.

1528
01:42:09,083 --> 01:42:11,958
Of course I did. Come on.

1529
01:42:12,041 --> 01:42:13,125
What am I, a rookie?

1530
01:42:13,208 --> 01:42:14,458
{\an8}<i>Rule number 5:</i>

1531
01:42:14,541 --> 01:42:17,500
{\an8}<i>Always do the Thanksgiving wishbone
with your bestie.</i>

1532
01:42:17,583 --> 01:42:18,416
{\an8}Okay.

1533
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:24,500
Here's wishing
that Rachel will give me a second chance.

1534
01:42:29,333 --> 01:42:30,416
So much for that.

1535
01:42:34,833 --> 01:42:38,833
All right, I'm giving us 48 hours
to feel sorry for ourselves.

1536
01:42:39,708 --> 01:42:43,041
Then we have Homecoming
and a kissing booth to do.

1537
01:43:04,125 --> 01:43:08,041
<i>Welcome to Homecoming!</i>

1538
01:43:12,166 --> 01:43:14,375
<i>He's open!</i>

1539
01:43:14,458 --> 01:43:17,208
Go, go!

1540
01:43:21,291 --> 01:43:24,166
<i>Touchdown Cougars</i>
<i>just before halftime!</i>

1541
01:43:24,708 --> 01:43:27,458
I see that Noah and Chloe are still here.

1542
01:43:27,791 --> 01:43:30,666
Oh, yeah. They, um...
They leave tomorrow night.

1543
01:43:30,750 --> 01:43:32,250
<i>All right, everyone!</i>

1544
01:43:32,333 --> 01:43:35,291
<i>It's the time
you've all been waiting for.</i>

1545
01:43:35,416 --> 01:43:38,166
And Homecoming King is...

1546
01:43:41,083 --> 01:43:42,041
Lee Flynn!

1547
01:43:44,291 --> 01:43:47,833
What? What? Wait! Whoa!

1548
01:43:48,916 --> 01:43:51,208
- I won!
- That's you!

1549
01:43:51,291 --> 01:43:52,583
I won!

1550
01:43:52,666 --> 01:43:56,500
- I gotta go down there!
- Yes! Oh, my God!

1551
01:43:57,541 --> 01:44:01,625
- I love you, man!
- I never doubted you! Little bit!

1552
01:44:30,416 --> 01:44:32,916
I don't know
if I should text her still.

1553
01:44:33,875 --> 01:44:35,000
You are the problem.

1554
01:44:35,083 --> 01:44:37,750
You ought to be proud,
let's be honest!

1555
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:40,166
Tell your brother congratulations.

1556
01:44:44,166 --> 01:44:46,375
- What did you say?
- I said congratulations.

1557
01:44:49,083 --> 01:44:50,375
Is there a problem?

1558
01:44:51,958 --> 01:44:53,958
You have no business talking to me.

1559
01:44:54,416 --> 01:44:55,291
Wow.

1560
01:44:55,750 --> 01:44:58,416
Someone says congratulations,
and you're ready to fight him.

1561
01:45:00,083 --> 01:45:01,125
You do have a problem.

1562
01:45:01,208 --> 01:45:03,541
No, the only problem I have
right now is you.

1563
01:45:04,166 --> 01:45:07,375
And you didn't come over here
to say congratulations, so just admit it.

1564
01:45:08,125 --> 01:45:10,291
Okay, let's go, Noah.

1565
01:45:15,041 --> 01:45:15,958
Noah.

1566
01:45:19,375 --> 01:45:20,500
Noah!

1567
01:45:25,541 --> 01:45:26,500
Let's go.

1568
01:45:28,458 --> 01:45:29,291
Good night.

1569
01:45:40,583 --> 01:45:42,875
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>a reminder for tomorrow night.</i>

1570
01:45:42,958 --> 01:45:47,625
<i>The LA Country Day Fiesta Fundraiser.
Don't miss out on the fun.</i>

1571
01:45:54,625 --> 01:45:56,291
All right, everybody!

1572
01:45:56,375 --> 01:45:59,833
The kissing booth is now open
for business!

1573
01:46:02,333 --> 01:46:05,666
All right, let's do this thing! Again!

1574
01:46:34,375 --> 01:46:35,458
You aren't bad!

1575
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:37,791
Hard to believe it's been a year.

1576
01:46:37,875 --> 01:46:39,625
It would have been my anniversary
with Rachel.

1577
01:46:41,583 --> 01:46:42,666
Do I really have to do this?

1578
01:46:43,416 --> 01:46:46,041
Come here.

1579
01:46:46,666 --> 01:46:47,916
You got this.

1580
01:46:55,208 --> 01:46:56,958
Whoo-hoo!

1581
01:47:36,708 --> 01:47:37,791
I missed you.

1582
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,083
I missed you too.

1583
01:47:48,625 --> 01:47:52,458
I am so sorry for ever making you feel

1584
01:47:52,541 --> 01:47:56,166
like anything less
than the most important person

1585
01:47:57,125 --> 01:47:58,250
in my life.

1586
01:47:59,458 --> 01:48:00,958
If you give me another chance,

1587
01:48:01,916 --> 01:48:03,166
I promise I will never...

1588
01:48:04,208 --> 01:48:06,166
make you feel that way ever again.

1589
01:48:09,708 --> 01:48:11,416
I love you so much.

1590
01:48:15,083 --> 01:48:16,625
And I don't wanna lose you.

1591
01:48:19,125 --> 01:48:20,291
You're not going to.

1592
01:48:38,625 --> 01:48:40,208
{\an8}<i>Rule number 5:</i>

1593
01:48:40,291 --> 01:48:42,916
{\an8}<i>Always do the Thanksgiving wishbone
with your bestie.</i>

1594
01:48:44,250 --> 01:48:47,333
<i>Lee just didn't know
that we both made the same wish.</i>

1595
01:48:59,916 --> 01:49:04,000
Everyone in this entire airport can see
that you are absolutely miserable.

1596
01:49:04,833 --> 01:49:06,083
You obviously want Elle.

1597
01:49:07,250 --> 01:49:10,666
So, as your friend, I have to demand
that you do something about it.

1598
01:49:11,875 --> 01:49:12,916
What's the point?

1599
01:49:15,375 --> 01:49:16,208
Look at me.

1600
01:49:21,125 --> 01:49:22,250
Do you love her?

1601
01:49:22,916 --> 01:49:25,333
I'm not talking to you
about this in an airport.

1602
01:49:25,416 --> 01:49:27,333
No. Stop it.

1603
01:49:27,833 --> 01:49:28,791
Do you love her?

1604
01:49:38,125 --> 01:49:38,958
Yeah.

1605
01:49:40,916 --> 01:49:42,250
Then tell her,

1606
01:49:43,708 --> 01:49:46,166
because not telling her is just stupid.

1607
01:49:47,416 --> 01:49:49,916
And you are arrogant

1608
01:49:50,333 --> 01:49:51,333
and stubborn

1609
01:49:51,958 --> 01:49:53,750
and a pain in the ass,

1610
01:49:55,458 --> 01:49:58,166
but one thing that you're not is stupid.

1611
01:50:05,833 --> 01:50:12,666
Ollie! Ollie! Ollie! Ollie!
Ollie! Ollie! Ollie!

1612
01:50:12,750 --> 01:50:14,583
Ollie! Ollie!

1613
01:50:16,625 --> 01:50:18,041
Come on!

1614
01:50:21,041 --> 01:50:22,541
Stay right there!

1615
01:50:23,041 --> 01:50:24,125
Excuse me.

1616
01:50:38,958 --> 01:50:40,083
Are you okay?

1617
01:51:10,916 --> 01:51:12,541
Do you have a ticket?

1618
01:51:39,375 --> 01:51:41,000
Whoo!

1619
01:51:44,916 --> 01:51:46,083
Oh, my God!

1620
01:51:56,208 --> 01:51:57,500
Oh, my God!

1621
01:52:07,333 --> 01:52:09,875
Whoa!

1622
01:52:09,958 --> 01:52:11,375
Okay.

1623
01:52:11,458 --> 01:52:12,583
Elle!

1624
01:52:15,666 --> 01:52:16,750
Thanks, Mia.

1625
01:52:18,541 --> 01:52:21,166
Kissin'! Here we go!

1626
01:52:21,583 --> 01:52:22,458
Okay.

1627
01:52:23,958 --> 01:52:25,708
Hello.

1628
01:52:25,833 --> 01:52:29,541
Sorry, I didn't realize I was gonna be
this nervous again! Oh, my goodness!

1629
01:52:29,625 --> 01:52:33,125
But don't worry. I've had, like,
three or four breath mints, so we are...

1630
01:52:33,208 --> 01:52:36,125
We are good to go
in that department.

1631
01:52:36,458 --> 01:52:37,791
All right.

1632
01:52:41,125 --> 01:52:45,041
I was kinda just hoping
my ticket is worth a minute of your time.

1633
01:52:53,166 --> 01:52:54,166
Hi.

1634
01:52:58,416 --> 01:53:00,291
I should've called you. I'm sorry.

1635
01:53:00,375 --> 01:53:03,458
I'm sorry about the other night with Noah.
It was... it was stupid.

1636
01:53:04,666 --> 01:53:07,791
But you can't deny
there's something real between us.

1637
01:53:08,291 --> 01:53:09,708
I don't know what it is.

1638
01:53:09,791 --> 01:53:12,750
Maybe we just got caught up
in the moment or something,

1639
01:53:12,833 --> 01:53:15,708
- 'cause I... there's...
- Please... please don't... do that.

1640
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:22,708
We felt something.

1641
01:53:24,041 --> 01:53:24,916
I know it.

1642
01:53:25,541 --> 01:53:27,208
Don't be afraid of how you feel.

1643
01:53:29,208 --> 01:53:33,083
I know how being afraid can hold you back
from getting what you really want.

1644
01:53:41,208 --> 01:53:43,083
Why do you think I joined the council?

1645
01:53:48,833 --> 01:53:49,791
You're right.

1646
01:53:54,208 --> 01:53:56,041
I do have feelings for you.

1647
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,291
When we kissed...

1648
01:54:01,458 --> 01:54:02,833
there was something there.

1649
01:54:14,250 --> 01:54:15,458
But you're not the one.

1650
01:54:19,208 --> 01:54:20,958
I really didn't mean to hurt you.

1651
01:54:24,791 --> 01:54:27,458
But you're not the one
that I'm lying to myself about.

1652
01:54:27,666 --> 01:54:31,875
And that's why I have to go,
and I have to find him

1653
01:54:31,958 --> 01:54:34,333
and find out what really happened.

1654
01:54:35,083 --> 01:54:36,708
I have to hear him out...

1655
01:54:37,625 --> 01:54:39,625
and make sure that he knows

1656
01:54:40,375 --> 01:54:41,875
I'm not slipping away.

1657
01:54:49,791 --> 01:54:50,791
Goodbye, Marco.

1658
01:55:04,625 --> 01:55:06,916
Sorry! Excuse me! Sorry! Sorry!

1659
01:55:31,166 --> 01:55:32,000
Excuse me!

1660
01:55:45,333 --> 01:55:46,541
Noah!

1661
01:55:46,958 --> 01:55:49,125
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.

1662
01:55:49,541 --> 01:55:51,291
- You look so much like my...
- Elle?

1663
01:55:52,083 --> 01:55:53,125
What are you doing here?

1664
01:55:54,125 --> 01:55:56,041
Where's... where's Noah?

1665
01:55:56,125 --> 01:55:57,833
He left. He went looking for you.

1666
01:55:58,416 --> 01:55:59,875
Wait, what?

1667
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:02,500
Look, that earring was nothing.

1668
01:56:02,708 --> 01:56:06,208
You've got to believe me, there is nothing
going on between Noah and me.

1669
01:56:07,833 --> 01:56:10,500
Do you know why he brought me home
for Thanksgiving?

1670
01:56:11,708 --> 01:56:15,208
He just wanted me there
so that we could become friends.

1671
01:56:16,375 --> 01:56:17,458
Oh, God.

1672
01:56:18,666 --> 01:56:21,333
- I feel so stupid.
- So does he.

1673
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
But he is crazy about you.

1674
01:56:25,125 --> 01:56:27,541
You must know that.

1675
01:56:29,333 --> 01:56:30,916
Is that him?

1676
01:56:31,333 --> 01:56:32,166
Yeah.

1677
01:56:33,791 --> 01:56:34,666
What did he say?

1678
01:56:37,791 --> 01:56:41,125
He's at the kissing booth.

1679
01:56:43,250 --> 01:56:45,625
Well, what are you waiting for?

1680
01:56:47,166 --> 01:56:48,333
Thank you, Chloe.

1681
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:52,333
Good luck.

1682
01:57:31,541 --> 01:57:32,916
Hey, I really need to talk to you.

1683
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:36,250
- You don't even have to say anything.
- No, Elle, please.

1684
01:57:37,041 --> 01:57:38,291
I need to say this.

1685
01:57:39,125 --> 01:57:40,833
When I started this school year,

1686
01:57:41,791 --> 01:57:43,083
I was pretty lonely,

1687
01:57:43,416 --> 01:57:45,958
and I wasn't really doing so well
in my classes.

1688
01:57:46,416 --> 01:57:47,958
Why didn't you say anything?

1689
01:57:49,750 --> 01:57:51,125
'Cause I was embarrassed.

1690
01:57:54,541 --> 01:57:56,333
Then I met, uh, Chloe,

1691
01:57:57,166 --> 01:58:00,208
and she showed me around,
introduced me to her friends and...

1692
01:58:01,541 --> 01:58:02,375
And...

1693
01:58:04,041 --> 01:58:07,000
I know we used to make fun of you and Lee
and your rules,

1694
01:58:08,041 --> 01:58:09,375
but I see what you guys have.

1695
01:58:12,666 --> 01:58:17,250
I guess a part of me just kinda wanted
to have the same thing with her.

1696
01:58:17,875 --> 01:58:18,875
Noah.

1697
01:58:18,958 --> 01:58:22,375
So then when you didn't believe
that her and I could just be friends,

1698
01:58:23,333 --> 01:58:25,833
it reminded me of what you used to think
about me...

1699
01:58:28,041 --> 01:58:29,208
And I didn't like that.

1700
01:58:31,333 --> 01:58:32,208
That was...

1701
01:58:33,958 --> 01:58:36,375
that was less about you and more just...

1702
01:58:38,416 --> 01:58:40,416
I just compared myself to her.

1703
01:58:45,541 --> 01:58:48,458
And when you left, I just kind of figured
that we would end,

1704
01:58:48,916 --> 01:58:50,583
so when I found the earring,

1705
01:58:51,166 --> 01:58:53,583
I made that the thing that would end it,
you know?

1706
01:58:53,666 --> 01:58:55,958
I know,
I wanted to stop you feeling jealous,

1707
01:58:56,041 --> 01:58:58,208
so I stopped telling you things.

1708
01:58:58,833 --> 01:59:01,375
I was so scared
you were gonna get on that plane...

1709
01:59:02,833 --> 01:59:05,833
before I could tell you
that I really didn't want you to go.

1710
01:59:07,041 --> 01:59:09,333
I thought I was leaving because of Marco.

1711
01:59:11,625 --> 01:59:13,416
I don't care that you kissed him,

1712
01:59:16,625 --> 01:59:18,041
but I need you to tell me...

1713
01:59:21,791 --> 01:59:22,791
do you love him?

1714
01:59:31,208 --> 01:59:35,375
Please try to remember
what I'm about to say, okay?

1715
01:59:41,375 --> 01:59:42,500
It's you, Noah.

1716
01:59:47,041 --> 01:59:48,208
It's always been you.

1717
02:00:38,041 --> 02:00:40,875
<i>So, what do I want to be</i>
<i>in five years?</i>

1718
02:00:41,750 --> 02:00:43,791
<i>Well, to be perfectly honest,</i>

1719
02:00:44,625 --> 02:00:46,750
<i>I haven't the slightest idea.</i>

1720
02:00:50,291 --> 02:00:53,791
<i>Most kids my age, whether they'd admit it
in a college essay or not,</i>

1721
02:00:54,250 --> 02:00:56,000
<i>are still trying to figure that out.</i>

1722
02:00:56,833 --> 02:01:00,500
<i>And maybe it's because</i>
<i>it's less about </i>what <i>I want to be</i>

1723
02:01:00,583 --> 02:01:02,791
<i>and more about </i>who <i>I want to be.</i>

1724
02:01:05,333 --> 02:01:06,916
<i>Because I can tell you this:</i>

1725
02:01:08,041 --> 02:01:12,541
<i>in five years,
I want to be my brother's joy.</i>

1726
02:01:13,833 --> 02:01:15,666
<i>I want to be my dad's love...</i>

1727
02:01:16,166 --> 02:01:18,416
<i>And my mom's warmth.</i>

1728
02:01:19,333 --> 02:01:22,041
<i>In five years,
I want to be Rachel's kindness.</i>

1729
02:01:22,125 --> 02:01:23,291
I guess I'm next.

1730
02:01:26,291 --> 02:01:28,083
<i>I want to be Noah's courage...</i>

1731
02:01:28,166 --> 02:01:30,416
I'm telling you that I love you.

1732
02:01:31,375 --> 02:01:32,708
<i>And his mom's wisdom.</i>

1733
02:01:33,708 --> 02:01:34,791
<i>But most of all...</i>

1734
02:01:37,750 --> 02:01:41,250
<i>I wanna be my best friend's laughter.</i>

1735
02:01:41,333 --> 02:01:45,625
<i>All those things together is
who I wanna be in five years.</i>

1736
02:01:45,958 --> 02:01:49,083
And so, on this auspicious day,

1737
02:01:49,166 --> 02:01:52,291
I leave you now with one final quote.

1738
02:01:52,958 --> 02:01:58,666
"I love to see a young girl go out
and grab the world by the lapels.

1739
02:02:00,333 --> 02:02:01,375
Life's a bitch.

1740
02:02:01,458 --> 02:02:05,875
You have to go out and kick ass!"

1741
02:02:06,708 --> 02:02:07,583
Maya Angelou.

1742
02:02:12,833 --> 02:02:16,916
<i>All of those things is who I want</i>
<i>to be in five years.</i>

1743
02:02:18,125 --> 02:02:20,083
<i>And anything else beyond that,</i>

1744
02:02:20,375 --> 02:02:24,291
<i>well, I might have to wait until I get
where I'm going to figure that out.</i>

1745
02:02:34,541 --> 02:02:36,291
Oh, so have you heard from Berkeley yet?

1746
02:02:37,458 --> 02:02:39,750
- Yeah.
- And?

1747
02:02:40,583 --> 02:02:41,666
Um...

1748
02:02:43,625 --> 02:02:44,833
No, Lee first.

1749
02:02:46,083 --> 02:02:50,291
- I got in!
- Oh, my God!

1750
02:02:50,875 --> 02:02:52,791
I have no idea.

1751
02:02:52,875 --> 02:02:54,458
That's my boy! I knew you would!

1752
02:02:54,541 --> 02:02:56,416
- All right, bro.
- What's up?

1753
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:58,125
So? What about you?

1754
02:02:58,625 --> 02:02:59,875
Um...

1755
02:03:00,541 --> 02:03:01,500
I, uh...

1756
02:03:03,041 --> 02:03:04,000
I...

1757
02:03:04,083 --> 02:03:07,083
I got wait-listed. Everywhere.

1758
02:03:08,125 --> 02:03:08,958
Berkeley

1759
02:03:09,791 --> 02:03:10,875
and Harvard.

1760
02:03:12,041 --> 02:03:13,125
I'm sorry, Rochelle.

1761
02:03:13,750 --> 02:03:14,833
Thanks, babe.

1762
02:03:20,250 --> 02:03:24,416
- Come on, bro. She's not worth it.
- I'm sure one of them will pan out.

1763
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:25,583
No, I know. You're right.

1764
02:03:27,041 --> 02:03:27,875
See you later.

1765
02:03:29,750 --> 02:03:31,416
- Don't worry.
- Yeah.

1766
02:03:32,916 --> 02:03:33,750
Yes, she is.

1767
02:03:35,333 --> 02:03:38,000
Ooh! Let's just forget
about that right now.

1768
02:03:38,083 --> 02:03:39,416
I wanna do something fun.

1769
02:03:40,541 --> 02:03:41,583
What do you want to do?

1770
02:03:52,958 --> 02:03:54,541
- Okay.
- Get 'em!

1771
02:04:06,166 --> 02:04:07,666
Oh, hey! You want to race?

1772
02:04:07,750 --> 02:04:09,625
Oh, get ready to eat my dust!

1773
02:04:12,291 --> 02:04:16,000
Whoo!

1774
02:04:16,083 --> 02:04:19,083
Whoo!

1775
02:04:22,916 --> 02:04:27,458
<i>I'm far from perfect</i>
<i>and a long way from knowing everything.</i>

1776
02:04:27,958 --> 02:04:32,208
<i>But I do know enough
to want to be the very best parts</i>

1777
02:04:32,291 --> 02:04:34,000
<i>of the people I love best.</i>

1778
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:38,750
<i>I only hope that someday I will be.</i>

1779
02:05:07,375 --> 02:05:08,208
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

1780
02:05:15,916 --> 02:05:19,458
Okay, remember, leave it to me
this time, all right? And no jokes.

1781
02:05:19,541 --> 02:05:21,958
Okay. You got it, boss.

1782
02:05:25,375 --> 02:05:26,250
Ooh.

1783
02:05:31,500 --> 02:05:32,916
{\an8}- Oh, shit!
- Yeah!

1784
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:34,708
{\an8}Oh! Whoa!

1785
02:05:34,791 --> 02:05:36,708
{\an8}Can you move that pickle to my bite?

1786
02:05:36,791 --> 02:05:38,916
You got scratches all over your face,
and you're kind of blurry.

1787
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:40,083
Hey, wait a minute.

1788
02:05:40,166 --> 02:05:44,000
Let's hold on so I can take the time
to move a pickle.

1789
02:05:51,208 --> 02:05:52,208
Shoot!

1790
02:05:54,791 --> 02:05:56,875
You got it.

1791
02:06:03,291 --> 02:06:04,916
Oh, my God.

1792
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:06,291
Oh, new level.

1793
02:06:12,458 --> 02:06:15,291
Oh, damn! These are kilograms, right?

1794
02:06:15,375 --> 02:06:18,250
Damn, girl.

1795
02:06:25,541 --> 02:06:27,833
My neck!

1796
02:06:29,541 --> 02:06:32,458
Whoo! Daddy!

1797
02:06:32,541 --> 02:06:34,500
Oh, Lord!

1798
02:06:37,875 --> 02:06:40,958
Who you've selected
for this year's kissing lineup.

1799
02:06:41,041 --> 02:06:42,291
Sorry, I up that line.

1800
02:06:42,375 --> 02:06:44,166
God, I love her voice.

1801
02:06:44,250 --> 02:06:45,500
Sounds like sunshine.

1802
02:06:46,125 --> 02:06:48,708
I can see right in your shirt.

1803
02:06:48,833 --> 02:06:53,666
I'm sorry, by the way, for being an idiot,
getting my line wrong.

1804
02:06:53,750 --> 02:06:55,750
Let's start again.

1805
02:06:55,833 --> 02:06:57,208
- Why not?
- Dude, I'm already...

1806
02:06:57,291 --> 02:06:59,458
doing your kissing booth.

1807
02:06:59,541 --> 02:07:01,541
Is there music?

1808
02:07:01,916 --> 02:07:04,458
Yeah, yeah. It's me.
I'm playing a slideshow.

1809
02:07:04,541 --> 02:07:08,166
Just gettin' in my emotions part of me,
everybody.

1810
02:07:08,250 --> 02:07:11,500
My Aunt Rose was just hit by a bus.

1811
02:07:11,583 --> 02:07:12,416
No.

1812
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:15,416
On a gambling trip in Germany.

1813
02:07:15,500 --> 02:07:18,958
I have you... have mercy. Have mercy! No!

1814
02:07:19,041 --> 02:07:20,875
Come on, Dad. Like, what the...

1815
02:07:20,958 --> 02:07:24,291
God! You always do this
when I'm in school. Shit!

1816
02:07:26,333 --> 02:07:28,125
Okay, we'll take it from here?

1817
02:07:28,250 --> 02:07:34,458
Are you speaking
really slowly?

1818
02:07:38,625 --> 02:07:40,833
Hello, camera.

1819
02:07:41,291 --> 02:07:44,125
You guys sound amazing.
Lucky, Marco was available, huh?

1820
02:07:44,208 --> 02:07:46,750
Yeah, I was actually really surprised
when he called yesterday

1821
02:07:46,833 --> 02:07:49,083
to ask if he could play with us.

1822
02:07:52,916 --> 02:07:55,625
Yeah, it's literally falling off.
It's actually ridiculous.

1823
02:07:55,708 --> 02:07:57,375
Uh, Brad. It's time for a shower, bud.

1824
02:07:57,458 --> 02:08:00,000
But I showered two days ago.
And I'm about to do the ramp jump.

1825
02:08:00,083 --> 02:08:02,291
You have literally never made
that ramp jump in your life.

1826
02:08:02,833 --> 02:08:03,666
Hey!

1827
02:08:08,833 --> 02:08:11,333
It's the John Travolta.

1828
02:08:11,416 --> 02:08:13,500
No way...

1829
02:08:14,666 --> 02:08:17,333
she's gonna give you a second chance, bae.

1830
02:08:17,416 --> 02:08:18,291
Good luck.

1831
02:08:18,375 --> 02:08:22,208
But in freestyle... but in... oh, my God.

1832
02:08:23,291 --> 02:08:25,875
- But in... freestyle.
- Freestyle.

1833
02:08:25,958 --> 02:08:27,291
Today's the difference.

1834
02:08:30,875 --> 02:08:32,875
Dude,
that broke his right off.

1835
02:08:33,375 --> 02:08:35,208
Oh, my God. It literally worked.

1836
02:08:35,291 --> 02:08:37,541
- Hello, there. Uh, I'm Lee Flynn.
- And I'm Elle Evans.

1837
02:08:37,625 --> 02:08:40,541
- We are your hosts of...
<i>- Game On!</i>

1838
02:08:43,833 --> 02:08:46,416
I called that shit.

1839
02:08:50,208 --> 02:08:52,625
This is stupid.

1840
02:08:52,708 --> 02:08:53,916
Everything is stupid.

1841
02:08:55,458 --> 02:08:58,833
Yearbook!

1842
02:08:59,375 --> 02:09:01,833
I'm sorry. I'd like to take that again,

1843
02:09:01,916 --> 02:09:03,500
'cause I smacked an extra.

1844
02:09:03,583 --> 02:09:05,291
So when will Marco be getting here?

1845
02:09:05,375 --> 02:09:08,041
Marco's actually not working
with us anymore.

1846
02:09:08,166 --> 02:09:11,958
Babes, that was not...
It's on your head now. What's she done?

1847
02:09:12,041 --> 02:09:14,208
It's my line. I'm sorry.

1848
02:09:14,333 --> 02:09:17,333
- He's, like, the most cool person ever.
- Wouldn't marry me.

1849
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,333
I thought we were... shit!

1850
02:09:22,416 --> 02:09:25,458
Hey, how come I never wear sunglasses
to school?

1851
02:09:25,541 --> 02:09:27,750
I don't know.
'Cause we drive a convertible.
