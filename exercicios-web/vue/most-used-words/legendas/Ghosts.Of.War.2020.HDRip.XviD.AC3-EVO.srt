<i>Get down!</i>

3
00:01:30,912 --> 00:01:32,980
<i>Get back! Get back!</i>

4
00:01:33,014 --> 00:01:34,248
<i>It's not working!</i>

5
00:01:34,982 --> 00:01:36,184
<i>Medic! Medic!</i>

6
00:01:36,217 --> 00:01:37,453
<i>What's your name?</i>

7
00:01:38,953 --> 00:01:39,854
<i>Gunfire everywhere!</i>

8
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:43,425
<i>Incoming!</i>

9
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,544
What do you want?

10
00:03:15,621 --> 00:03:16,988
Hey, Butchie.

11
00:03:17,022 --> 00:03:18,424
You got an extra pair
of them socks?

12
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,493
These dogs is
itching me like crazy.

13
00:03:20,526 --> 00:03:22,227
Should've packed two pair.

14
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:23,663
I did.

15
00:03:23,696 --> 00:03:26,065
Put holes in the first pair
after three days.

16
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:29,168
Damn it.

17
00:03:30,571 --> 00:03:32,773
I wish I was born flat foot.

18
00:03:32,806 --> 00:03:34,675
My cousin's kid brother
got flat feet,

19
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,277
he found out he couldn't
get into the army.

20
00:03:37,311 --> 00:03:39,078
He hung himself
in my uncle's barn.

21
00:03:40,213 --> 00:03:42,449
You're so full of shit, Kirk.

22
00:03:42,483 --> 00:03:44,751
Your cousin's kid brother's
still your cousin, ain't he?

23
00:03:44,785 --> 00:03:46,118
Why would you
call him anything else?

24
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:49,324
No kidding, he's my cousin.

25
00:03:49,357 --> 00:03:50,758
Who would lie about that?

26
00:03:53,495 --> 00:03:55,128
Do you even know why you lie?

27
00:03:56,397 --> 00:03:57,665
Who you crackin' wise at?

28
00:03:59,334 --> 00:04:01,603
The outpost
is 30 miles over those hills.

29
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,404
Let's move out.

30
00:04:35,236 --> 00:04:36,339
Feel a jeep comin'.

31
00:04:43,145 --> 00:04:44,614
How many M7s we got?

32
00:05:04,869 --> 00:05:07,538
Maybe we should've
spared that jeep.

33
00:05:07,572 --> 00:05:08,839
Still have
a long way to walk.

34
00:05:10,274 --> 00:05:12,877
Yeah, 'cause it worked out
so well for them.

35
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,479
Nazis ain't
so tough now, are ya?

36
00:05:20,183 --> 00:05:22,453
You ain't gonna be
needing this. Nope.

37
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:32,631
Hey, Butchie, keep your eyes out
for any maps, coded messages,

38
00:05:32,664 --> 00:05:34,533
anything we can use
against these guys.

39
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:35,867
What do you
think I'm doing?

40
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,650
Hey, Butchie,
we got a live one.

41
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:55,722
You want I should
reel him in?

42
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,155
Or throw him back?

43
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:59,559
He's a major. That'll do.

44
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:02,729
Let's go, Jerry,
put up your dukes.

45
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,666
<i>♪ When you're smilin'</i>

46
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,870
<i>♪ Oh, when you're smilin'</i>

47
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,474
<i>♪ The whole world smiles...</i>

48
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:14,908
<i>♪ ...with you... ♪</i>

49
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,714
Huh?

50
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:22,215
Huh?

51
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,285
Shut up, Eugene.

52
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,489
Scruff fuck knows exactly
what I'm saying. Huh?

53
00:06:48,443 --> 00:06:49,444
Huh?

54
00:06:50,612 --> 00:06:51,613
All right.

55
00:06:56,818 --> 00:06:59,354
- Huh? All right.
- Yeah.

56
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,729
Hey,
look at Rocky Graziano.

57
00:07:11,867 --> 00:07:14,537
Mother Mary, this guy is good.

58
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,906
Nearest crossing now
is two miles over that hill.

59
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:18,340
Go get him, Butchie.

60
00:07:19,475 --> 00:07:21,677
Yep.

61
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:23,546
Come on, you're swinging
like a ding-a-ling.

62
00:07:34,758 --> 00:07:38,428
Sorry, guys, we're way behind.
Think I made a wrong turn.

63
00:07:38,462 --> 00:07:39,463
Pack up.

64
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:15,696
I won't hurt you.

65
00:09:18,032 --> 00:09:19,366
It's okay.

66
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,478
Take it.

67
00:10:26,737 --> 00:10:28,939
<i>Feels like
my feet are gonna fall off.</i>

68
00:10:28,972 --> 00:10:30,474
<i>Once we get there,
it'll be cake.</i>

69
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:32,709
You guys can sleep for days.

70
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,513
Who we babysitting
this time?

71
00:10:35,546 --> 00:10:36,781
Not a "who."

72
00:10:36,814 --> 00:10:39,183
A mansion or a castle.

73
00:10:39,217 --> 00:10:40,451
It's supposed to be a big deal

74
00:10:40,485 --> 00:10:41,719
when the 82nd Airborne
came through

75
00:10:41,753 --> 00:10:44,489
and pushed out
the Nazi High Command.

76
00:10:44,522 --> 00:10:46,691
We're to hold it
till our relief comes.

77
00:10:46,724 --> 00:10:49,560
- How long is that?
- As long as it takes.

78
00:10:49,594 --> 00:10:53,498
Yowza, yowza, yowza.
Clean sheets and toilet paper.

79
00:10:59,905 --> 00:11:02,541
No wonder the Nazis
commandeered it.

80
00:11:03,609 --> 00:11:06,879
Yeah. What's not to love?

81
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,491
Maybe he's just sleeping.

82
00:11:19,525 --> 00:11:21,593
Yeah, not enough rooms.

83
00:11:23,195 --> 00:11:24,965
Easy, little,
your relief is here.

84
00:11:24,998 --> 00:11:27,067
You fall asleep star gazing
or something?

85
00:11:28,969 --> 00:11:30,937
Get your gear.
Our relief is here.

86
00:11:34,975 --> 00:11:36,876
I think I died
and gone to heaven, boys.

87
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,944
Man, you kidding me?

88
00:11:37,978 --> 00:11:39,012
Look at this.

89
00:11:39,045 --> 00:11:40,847
This place is as big
as Roseland.

90
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,949
It's bigger than my whole
neighborhood in Queens.

91
00:11:42,983 --> 00:11:45,185
Okay, gear up and fall in.
We're out in two minutes.

92
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,155
- Wow.
- What's the hurry?

93
00:11:48,189 --> 00:11:49,056
There's no hurry.

94
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,891
Why aren't you all
sleeping in the beds?

95
00:11:52,093 --> 00:11:53,561
It don't have bedbugs
or something?

96
00:11:53,594 --> 00:11:56,163
Yeah, bedbugs.

97
00:11:56,197 --> 00:11:58,132
We put most of the mattresses
in the basement.

98
00:12:00,034 --> 00:12:01,202
What's the story,
morning glory?

99
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,038
Any news on that thing?

100
00:12:04,071 --> 00:12:05,573
No.

101
00:12:05,606 --> 00:12:07,274
Uh, it doesn't
pick up much out here.

102
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,276
Must be broken.

103
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,880
Broken, huh?
Maybe you should leave it with us.

104
00:12:13,682 --> 00:12:16,118
Eugene there is a regular
Marconian with a screwdriver.

105
00:12:21,357 --> 00:12:22,557
Yeah.

106
00:12:24,192 --> 00:12:25,193
Yeah.

107
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:29,898
- Can I go now?
- Not yet.

108
00:12:35,605 --> 00:12:37,240
Where's the grub?

109
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:39,275
This place was
a crowd base for operations,

110
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:41,210
they stacked the pantry
full of sausage, cheeses,

111
00:12:41,244 --> 00:12:43,079
wine and all the brandy
that you can drink.

112
00:12:43,112 --> 00:12:44,814
Supply truck comes through
to re-up in a week.

113
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,849
They'll have fresh bread
and K-rations.

114
00:12:46,883 --> 00:12:48,084
So what's wrong with the joint?

115
00:12:49,752 --> 00:12:51,654
I mean, if this place
is like Coney Island,

116
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:52,722
what's the rush?

117
00:12:52,755 --> 00:12:54,223
You're a day late.

118
00:12:54,257 --> 00:12:55,958
We're behind schedule.
And some of us would like

119
00:12:55,992 --> 00:12:57,660
to make furlough,
okay, asshole?

120
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,037
Let's go.

121
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,988
One of them left
their rucksack behind.

122
00:13:30,962 --> 00:13:32,364
What do you mean
you never had fondue?

123
00:13:32,398 --> 00:13:33,698
Were you raised in a brothel?

124
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:36,668
Give him pots and pans
and his <i>Little Lord Fauntleroy.</i>

125
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,639
Hey, how far's the nearest
cat house anyway?

126
00:13:41,673 --> 00:13:43,942
Heard the French girls
are cut sideways.

127
00:13:43,975 --> 00:13:47,178
It's the Jap girls that are
cut sideways, ya ding-a-ling.

128
00:13:49,048 --> 00:13:50,783
I don't see why
we should be on lockdown.

129
00:13:50,816 --> 00:13:52,151
We could be here all week.

130
00:13:52,184 --> 00:13:53,819
I'm gonna take a look
around the house.

131
00:13:58,858 --> 00:13:59,859
How about a fondue?

132
00:14:02,094 --> 00:14:03,095
Eugene!

133
00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:05,030
The cheese!

134
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:38,458
Boo.

135
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,539
This is the life, boys.

136
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:35,709
What?

137
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,611
Is that any good?

138
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:41,080
Oh, yeah,
it's about a machine

139
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,382
that's supposed
to be a mental portal

140
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:43,684
between dimensions,
but it turns out,

141
00:19:43,717 --> 00:19:46,052
it's also a portal
between times.

142
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,622
You could've just said no.

143
00:19:57,732 --> 00:19:59,667
Break's over.

144
00:20:44,246 --> 00:20:45,415
What the hell is that?

145
00:21:45,811 --> 00:21:47,880
Geez, what the fuck?

146
00:22:05,263 --> 00:22:07,500
Three, two, one.

147
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,209
What the hell was that?

148
00:22:16,644 --> 00:22:17,778
You saw it, too?

149
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,248
Not sure what I saw.

150
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,793
Earl Grey?

151
00:22:38,867 --> 00:22:40,035
It's true.

152
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:43,405
My cousin's letter says,
"They're treating SPOW as well.

153
00:22:44,271 --> 00:22:45,106
"The food ain't so bad.

154
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,841
"And we get to play
baseball all day.

155
00:22:47,876 --> 00:22:49,778
"I love you.

156
00:22:49,811 --> 00:22:51,646
"And I can't wait to see you
after the war."

157
00:22:53,548 --> 00:22:55,550
And then at the bottom
in the letter, he writes,

158
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:58,688
"P.S., save this stamp
for Uncle Harold."

159
00:23:00,623 --> 00:23:02,491
Except there is no Uncle Harold
in the family.

160
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,429
So we analyzed steams
off the stamp.

161
00:23:06,462 --> 00:23:07,730
All curious, you know.

162
00:23:09,398 --> 00:23:11,299
And underneath,

163
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:13,636
written in small letters,
five words...

164
00:23:16,038 --> 00:23:17,606
"They've cut out my tongue."

165
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,641
God.

166
00:23:28,719 --> 00:23:29,720
What's that?

167
00:23:30,687 --> 00:23:32,456
Ah, I found it in the basement.

168
00:23:32,489 --> 00:23:35,325
Belonged to one of the Nazis
who took over the house.

169
00:23:35,358 --> 00:23:37,661
Dieter Werner. 18 years old.

170
00:23:38,662 --> 00:23:39,863
Nazi shithead.

171
00:23:41,531 --> 00:23:43,299
You guys remember Louis
from Bravo Company,

172
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,301
the ginger from the pig farm?

173
00:23:45,335 --> 00:23:46,603
How that old whore
stole his money roll,

174
00:23:46,637 --> 00:23:48,005
locked herself
in the bathroom?

175
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:49,272
What about her?

176
00:23:49,306 --> 00:23:51,409
He hears glass breaking,
she starts screaming bloody murder,

177
00:23:51,442 --> 00:23:52,877
so he starts
pounding on the door,

178
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,779
trying to break in,
but the door's solid.

179
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,382
And for a couple of minutes,
he gets through.

180
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:00,685
Sees a broken window,
the woman's ear in the sink,

181
00:24:00,718 --> 00:24:03,688
and written in the vanity
in lipstick,

182
00:24:03,721 --> 00:24:06,424
"Welcome to the wonderful
world of the clap."

183
00:24:10,595 --> 00:24:13,332
You're
so full of shit, Butchie.

184
00:24:25,778 --> 00:24:26,779
Do you hear that?

185
00:24:29,047 --> 00:24:30,849
I hope it doesn't
do that all night.

186
00:24:30,883 --> 00:24:32,518
I might have to sleep outside.

187
00:24:32,551 --> 00:24:34,453
You should
if you're gonna read crap.

188
00:24:34,486 --> 00:24:35,488
Well...

189
00:24:36,923 --> 00:24:38,491
I could see
why they left it behind.

190
00:24:38,525 --> 00:24:40,693
It says what happened
to the family who lived here.

191
00:24:40,727 --> 00:24:42,629
And what he did to them.

192
00:24:42,662 --> 00:24:44,964
Guys, I think I'm going cuckoo.

193
00:24:44,998 --> 00:24:47,033
Is that Morse Code?

194
00:24:58,779 --> 00:25:00,047
I...

195
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,081
H...

196
00:25:02,383 --> 00:25:03,617
A...

197
00:25:03,651 --> 00:25:04,652
V...

198
00:25:05,486 --> 00:25:06,487
E...

199
00:25:07,054 --> 00:25:08,455
N...

200
00:25:08,489 --> 00:25:09,523
O...

201
00:25:09,557 --> 00:25:10,825
Bullshit.

202
00:25:10,858 --> 00:25:11,859
L...

203
00:25:12,993 --> 00:25:13,994
E...

204
00:25:15,563 --> 00:25:16,564
G...

205
00:25:18,432 --> 00:25:19,433
S.

206
00:25:19,867 --> 00:25:21,402
"I have no legs"?

207
00:25:31,713 --> 00:25:32,814
Jesus.

208
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,425
Oh.

209
00:25:46,428 --> 00:25:47,763
Get rid of that.
It's covered in disease.

210
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:49,932
Tsk. Who you supposed
to be, my momma?

211
00:25:50,766 --> 00:25:51,767
Stop.

212
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:54,070
That was bullshit, right?

213
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:57,640
Tappert,
take the attic tonight.

214
00:25:57,673 --> 00:25:59,609
Best vantage point
if there's any conflict.

215
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:03,446
We can all sleep
in a bed tonight.

216
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,047
And stay within
shouting distance.

217
00:26:05,081 --> 00:26:06,515
Until we know
what the fuck's happening.

218
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,861
Come on.

219
00:26:50,962 --> 00:26:51,963
Open up.

220
00:27:25,031 --> 00:27:26,132
Shit.

221
00:29:55,988 --> 00:29:58,724
So, anyone wanna
talk about last night?

222
00:30:17,043 --> 00:30:20,046
These boys seem like
they wanted out in a hurry.

223
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,249
Ever find out
whose rucksack that was?

224
00:30:22,282 --> 00:30:23,750
Tappert's going through it.

225
00:30:24,718 --> 00:30:26,086
Think he'll find any gold teeth?

226
00:30:27,287 --> 00:30:28,688
He gives me the shivers.

227
00:30:29,624 --> 00:30:31,758
- I mean, after Paris...
- Drop it, you two.

228
00:30:31,791 --> 00:30:34,194
You didn't find them sitting
in a pool of blood.

229
00:30:34,227 --> 00:30:37,765
Six or seven 15-year-olds
all... carved up.

230
00:30:37,798 --> 00:30:38,833
Hitler Youth.

231
00:30:38,866 --> 00:30:40,168
Guts all on the floor.

232
00:30:40,201 --> 00:30:41,336
And he's sitting there,
you know,

233
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,070
with that look he gets.

234
00:30:43,905 --> 00:30:45,474
That weird smile...

235
00:30:45,507 --> 00:30:47,975
And telling me
they were smuggling diamonds.

236
00:30:48,009 --> 00:30:49,043
He showed you
any diamonds?

237
00:30:49,076 --> 00:30:50,745
What do you think?

238
00:30:50,778 --> 00:30:52,146
Have I ever told you guys
this part?

239
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,048
He holds up his hands.

240
00:30:54,081 --> 00:30:55,850
He's got string
around his fingers.

241
00:30:55,883 --> 00:30:57,051
You know, a cat's cradle?

242
00:30:57,885 --> 00:30:58,887
And he just goes...

243
00:31:01,089 --> 00:31:02,191
"Your move."

244
00:31:06,895 --> 00:31:08,096
All dreamily.

245
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:11,066
Okay. That's a little laggy.

246
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:13,101
One last thing
to pull your coat to.

247
00:31:13,135 --> 00:31:14,470
It wasn't the first move.

248
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,408
You know, like, a cat's cradle,

249
00:31:18,441 --> 00:31:20,709
the first 10 moves are easy
and then it gets hard.

250
00:31:21,377 --> 00:31:23,213
So...

251
00:31:23,246 --> 00:31:25,449
who helped him get
to move five

252
00:31:25,482 --> 00:31:27,317
in a room full of dead kids?

253
00:31:34,891 --> 00:31:36,192
Glad he's on our side.

254
00:31:43,866 --> 00:31:46,338
I think I figured out
what put the bee in the bonnets

255
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,272
of the last squad
that was here.

256
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:56,013
Radio said there's
a German line coming through

257
00:31:56,046 --> 00:31:58,516
from Nuremberg
to some kind of camp,

258
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,218
in... in Strasbourg.

259
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:03,854
There's some trucks.

260
00:32:03,887 --> 00:32:06,023
Maybe a couple dozen
Jerries on foot.

261
00:32:07,324 --> 00:32:08,493
Shit.

262
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:10,829
Look, I say we gear up,

263
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:13,098
head into those woods
and wait for 'em to pass.

264
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:15,534
We stay here,
we're fish in a barrel.

265
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:18,870
We can't leave.

266
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:21,440
Five guys against 50.

267
00:32:21,474 --> 00:32:23,376
- It's plain suicide.
- We're staying.

268
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:32,217
Great. Okay.

269
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,589
Well, then I guess I'll just go up to
the attic and try to spot 'em then.

270
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:37,323
Either of you wanna
maybe come help?

271
00:32:38,858 --> 00:32:39,859
Eugene?

272
00:32:43,597 --> 00:32:44,797
Come on.

273
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:47,567
We can play cat's cradle.

274
00:32:58,111 --> 00:33:00,515
Not talking about people
not in the room.

275
00:33:00,548 --> 00:33:01,549
What?

276
00:33:05,453 --> 00:33:07,020
What the hell is that?

277
00:33:08,088 --> 00:33:09,189
Black magic.

278
00:33:11,191 --> 00:33:13,193
Sacrificial altars.

279
00:33:16,129 --> 00:33:18,566
They say Hitler is
a big believer in the occult.

280
00:33:20,568 --> 00:33:22,371
They say, huh?

281
00:33:22,404 --> 00:33:25,507
The Nazis must've committed
ritualistic killings on the Helwigs.

282
00:33:31,447 --> 00:33:32,614
Sick pervs.

283
00:33:34,982 --> 00:33:35,983
Hey.

284
00:33:36,552 --> 00:33:37,553
Give me a hand, will you?

285
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,000
You wanna take it over there?

286
00:33:52,034 --> 00:33:53,035
Yeah, okay.

287
00:33:53,969 --> 00:33:55,338
Got it. I got it.

288
00:33:55,372 --> 00:33:56,406
- Ready?
- Mm-hm.

289
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,608
One...

290
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:10,421
Oh, fuck! You motherfucker!

291
00:34:10,454 --> 00:34:11,988
Hey, that wasn't me.

292
00:34:12,021 --> 00:34:14,157
Get away from me!

293
00:34:15,024 --> 00:34:16,627
God.

294
00:34:31,174 --> 00:34:32,208
You hear that?

295
00:34:41,453 --> 00:34:45,490
<i>...burning for eternity.
They're coming for you.</i>

296
00:34:45,524 --> 00:34:46,725
<i>We steal joy...</i>

297
00:34:46,758 --> 00:34:48,693
What is that?

298
00:34:48,727 --> 00:34:51,929
<i>...falls apart
and reap your memories.</i>

299
00:34:55,467 --> 00:34:57,134
I don't believe in witches,

300
00:34:57,168 --> 00:34:59,372
but if an old hag flies around
on a broom stick...

301
00:34:59,405 --> 00:35:01,507
Please tell me we're having
this conversation right now.

302
00:35:01,541 --> 00:35:03,543
- I thought I was going batshit.
- Yeah, me, too.

303
00:35:03,576 --> 00:35:05,711
Now I know why the last bunch
was so desperate to amscray.

304
00:35:05,745 --> 00:35:07,680
I mean, this place is...

305
00:35:07,713 --> 00:35:08,714
Haunted.

306
00:35:10,349 --> 00:35:12,117
Unless someone's got
a better word for it.

307
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:15,555
Look, before the Nazis come,
we should, like, 23 skidoo.

308
00:35:24,398 --> 00:35:25,566
What is that?

309
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,217
I...

310
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,251
F...

311
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:46,688
Y...

312
00:35:47,321 --> 00:35:48,389
O...

313
00:35:48,423 --> 00:35:49,457
U...

314
00:35:49,491 --> 00:35:50,625
"If you..." L...

315
00:35:51,325 --> 00:35:53,093
E... God!

316
00:35:53,126 --> 00:35:54,729
A-V...

317
00:35:54,762 --> 00:35:56,330
"If you leave..."

318
00:35:59,534 --> 00:36:01,034
Eugene, what the...

319
00:36:01,068 --> 00:36:02,202
What the fuck is happening?

320
00:36:02,236 --> 00:36:03,404
I'm not writing!

321
00:36:03,438 --> 00:36:05,339
I'm not writing! Ah!

322
00:36:05,373 --> 00:36:06,407
Fuck!

323
00:36:07,307 --> 00:36:09,076
<i>If you leave,</i>

324
00:36:09,109 --> 00:36:10,446
<i>you'll die!</i>

325
00:36:31,099 --> 00:36:32,200
What?

326
00:36:36,773 --> 00:36:40,410
It'd be nice if someone left something
in these we can actually use.

327
00:36:42,177 --> 00:36:43,480
I'm gonna go
padlock the front door

328
00:36:43,513 --> 00:36:45,348
and make them think that
we abandoned the place.

329
00:36:45,382 --> 00:36:46,650
If they come in
looking for food...

330
00:36:47,651 --> 00:36:49,051
not our first rodeo.

331
00:37:42,441 --> 00:37:43,475
Thanks.

332
00:38:33,795 --> 00:38:34,929
Okay, they're moving on.

333
00:38:35,664 --> 00:38:36,698
They're moving on.

334
00:38:39,801 --> 00:38:41,436
Fuck.

335
00:38:45,774 --> 00:38:47,776
- Damn it!
- That son of a bitch.

336
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:09,565
Grenade!

337
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:10,800
Butchie, no!

338
00:39:27,651 --> 00:39:29,318
Eugene!

339
00:39:29,352 --> 00:39:31,354
- Chris!
- Come on!

340
00:39:31,988 --> 00:39:33,356
Where are you?

341
00:39:34,591 --> 00:39:37,594
Chris, we need to cover!
We need to cover from the back!

342
00:39:38,762 --> 00:39:40,262
He's not here!

343
00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:42,666
We're coming to get you.
Where are you?

344
00:39:42,699 --> 00:39:43,934
Chris, where are you?

345
00:39:53,845 --> 00:39:54,879
Come fast!

346
00:40:01,486 --> 00:40:02,487
Out here!

347
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:07,391
Oh, shit. Oh, fuck.

348
00:40:07,425 --> 00:40:08,726
Shit! Fuck!

349
00:43:31,771 --> 00:43:33,540
No!

350
00:43:53,594 --> 00:43:54,862
This isn't real.

351
00:43:54,895 --> 00:43:56,530
This isn't real.

352
00:44:38,174 --> 00:44:40,309
Always gotta be the hero.

353
00:44:40,343 --> 00:44:42,078
How much morphine
we have left?

354
00:44:43,179 --> 00:44:44,614
Enough to do the job...

355
00:44:45,648 --> 00:44:46,916
if we have to.

356
00:44:47,884 --> 00:44:49,852
Take this trash out
with the rest of 'em.

357
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:02,032
What the hell did you do?

358
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,705
You wouldn't understand it.

359
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:13,677
Strip him down
and put him with the rest.

360
00:45:23,254 --> 00:45:25,690
What the hell
does haunted even mean?

361
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,926
Does that mean
specific people have ghosts

362
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:30,695
that are somehow anchored
to the places they died?

363
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:33,031
Or is it the places
where evil's occurred

364
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:35,834
that makes the portal
to demonic forces?

365
00:45:35,867 --> 00:45:38,670
Or was evil simply a manmade
concept in the first place?

366
00:45:38,703 --> 00:45:41,239
Will you
give it a rest already?

367
00:45:41,272 --> 00:45:43,341
Look, evil is just...

368
00:45:46,979 --> 00:45:49,782
Well, it's what makes
the violence so much fun.

369
00:45:51,684 --> 00:45:52,852
Everything we experienced,

370
00:45:52,885 --> 00:45:55,754
it's what what the Nazis did
to the family that lived here.

371
00:45:55,788 --> 00:45:56,989
The Helwigs,

372
00:45:57,022 --> 00:45:58,425
despite their French
royal lineage,

373
00:45:58,458 --> 00:45:59,959
were hiding Jews.

374
00:45:59,992 --> 00:46:02,695
So, the house
fell into Nazi hands.

375
00:46:02,728 --> 00:46:03,796
And when the Nazis
finally came,

376
00:46:03,829 --> 00:46:05,297
they smashed the doors down

377
00:46:05,331 --> 00:46:07,099
and the children ran and hid.

378
00:46:07,133 --> 00:46:10,804
But Mr. Helwig was found
right here in the library.

379
00:46:10,837 --> 00:46:12,873
So, the Nazis
tied him to a chair.

380
00:46:12,906 --> 00:46:15,742
Mrs. Helwig was hiding
in the kitchen pantry.

381
00:46:15,775 --> 00:46:18,446
So they dragged her upstairs
where they found her son

382
00:46:18,479 --> 00:46:20,714
hiding in the armoire
in the attic.

383
00:46:20,747 --> 00:46:24,217
<i>They drowned her boy
in the upstairs bathtub</i>

384
00:46:24,251 --> 00:46:26,286
and forced her to watch
at gunpoint.

385
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:27,754
They found the daughter

386
00:46:27,787 --> 00:46:30,090
hiding in the servants'
quarters. Cristina.

387
00:46:30,123 --> 00:46:32,159
So they dragged her
upstairs to the attic

388
00:46:32,192 --> 00:46:35,196
<i>and hanged her
from the rafters.</i>

389
00:46:35,229 --> 00:46:38,032
They carried the screaming mom
down to the library

390
00:46:38,065 --> 00:46:40,369
where they had soaked
her husband in kerosene,

391
00:46:40,402 --> 00:46:42,737
laughing as they
set him on fire.

392
00:46:45,907 --> 00:46:47,775
They tossed their bodies
in a heap.

393
00:46:48,209 --> 00:46:49,810
No funerals,

394
00:46:49,844 --> 00:46:51,245
no headstones.

395
00:46:51,279 --> 00:46:53,214
Is that why they're,
you know,

396
00:46:53,981 --> 00:46:55,816
still here?

397
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:58,488
No Christian burial,
that sort of thing?

398
00:46:58,521 --> 00:47:00,756
Wandering the Earth
with unfinished business?

399
00:47:04,293 --> 00:47:05,961
I'm gonna go
check on Butchie.

400
00:47:09,399 --> 00:47:11,867
It's all right, bro.

401
00:47:50,241 --> 00:47:51,509
Put it away.

402
00:47:53,445 --> 00:47:55,480
My father was a milkman.

403
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:03,120
My mother was my dead mother
now a memory.

404
00:48:04,355 --> 00:48:06,857
I always had a thing
for scary movies.

405
00:48:07,358 --> 00:48:08,359
You know?

406
00:48:10,328 --> 00:48:12,864
<i>Abbott and Costello
Meet the Mummy.</i>

407
00:48:12,897 --> 00:48:15,233
<i>I Was a Teenage Werewolf.</i>

408
00:48:16,968 --> 00:48:18,103
Kids stuff.

409
00:48:21,006 --> 00:48:22,541
The scarier, the better.

410
00:48:28,481 --> 00:48:31,349
After Normandy,
I've seen and...

411
00:48:33,553 --> 00:48:35,121
Done things.

412
00:48:49,068 --> 00:48:51,837
Did I ever tell you how
I didn't sleep for five days

413
00:48:51,871 --> 00:48:53,939
when I marched
through Stuttgart?

414
00:48:58,345 --> 00:48:59,514
Five days.

415
00:49:01,114 --> 00:49:05,520
They say it's not possible
without losing your mind.

416
00:49:05,553 --> 00:49:11,191
I couldn't tell if I was
dreaming or awake after three.

417
00:49:11,224 --> 00:49:14,495
And in my more lucid moments,
I wondered if I was ever gonna

418
00:49:16,163 --> 00:49:17,964
get back to normal again.

419
00:49:24,238 --> 00:49:26,442
What I did
to those Hitler Youth kids

420
00:49:26,475 --> 00:49:28,544
was a fucking nightmare.

421
00:49:28,577 --> 00:49:31,946
And I admit it,
I got the control.

422
00:49:31,979 --> 00:49:34,849
I wanted to kill the eggs
before they hatched.

423
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:38,052
It was like floating
above my body,

424
00:49:38,086 --> 00:49:39,987
looking down on myself

425
00:49:40,021 --> 00:49:43,592
when I cut that little
blond boy's head off.

426
00:49:43,625 --> 00:49:45,994
It was like
I wasn't doing it at all.

427
00:49:50,433 --> 00:49:53,302
I mean, I remember just...

428
00:49:53,335 --> 00:49:55,904
watching myself sitting there
when that...

429
00:49:57,973 --> 00:50:00,410
that body just got up
off the ground.

430
00:50:04,714 --> 00:50:06,583
Total insanity.

431
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:11,321
Fever dream.

432
00:50:11,354 --> 00:50:13,657
And then he pulled a piece
of string out of his pocket,

433
00:50:13,691 --> 00:50:17,360
that... body without
a head, and...

434
00:50:17,395 --> 00:50:20,464
and he held his hands out
and he made a cat's cradle,

435
00:50:20,498 --> 00:50:23,401
and... and what am I gonna do?
I just cut...

436
00:50:24,468 --> 00:50:28,204
his fucking head off,
Am I gonna be rude?

437
00:50:33,076 --> 00:50:35,212
So I played with him
for a while.

438
00:50:40,251 --> 00:50:41,620
And then he just

439
00:50:42,754 --> 00:50:44,321
laid back down.

440
00:50:49,594 --> 00:50:52,464
I'm pretty sure it was...
it was a dream.

441
00:50:56,668 --> 00:50:59,337
I was just...
I was just too scared to move.

442
00:51:01,072 --> 00:51:04,710
So I sat there holding
that cat's cradle for hours

443
00:51:04,744 --> 00:51:07,979
until you came and you
found me with the bodies.

444
00:51:13,419 --> 00:51:16,254
I completely forgot that
that ever happened.

445
00:51:20,626 --> 00:51:23,196
- Yesterday I reminded you.
- Yeah.

446
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,614
Kirk, you forgot
to drain the tub.

447
00:52:12,548 --> 00:52:14,215
I'm here to help you.

448
00:52:59,129 --> 00:53:00,297
Let go!

449
00:53:02,198 --> 00:53:03,401
Hey.

450
00:53:04,769 --> 00:53:07,070
It's another dream, man.

451
00:53:16,279 --> 00:53:17,615
How much longer can you go
without food?

452
00:53:20,618 --> 00:53:22,353
So what're we gonna do, Chris?

453
00:53:22,387 --> 00:53:23,855
No one wants to stay here
another night.

454
00:53:23,889 --> 00:53:25,824
We'll be court-martialed
for deserting our posts.

455
00:53:27,659 --> 00:53:29,027
Hey, Tap.

456
00:53:29,061 --> 00:53:31,730
Do you think you could find that
Nazi truck again if you had to?

457
00:53:31,763 --> 00:53:34,265
I mean, it wouldn't matter.
I slashed the tires.

458
00:53:37,536 --> 00:53:39,337
Maybe our relief will come soon.

459
00:53:44,175 --> 00:53:46,211
All right, Butch.

460
00:53:46,244 --> 00:53:49,782
The next bit is about quantum
entanglement. Dullsville.

461
00:53:49,816 --> 00:53:53,620
"And then the Martian visitor
explained that the deeds from one life

462
00:53:53,653 --> 00:53:56,355
"are carried with you
into the next.

463
00:53:56,389 --> 00:53:59,759
"So reincarnation from
Martians..."

464
00:54:11,772 --> 00:54:13,641
What are we looking for, anyway?

465
00:54:13,674 --> 00:54:15,174
I don't know.

466
00:54:15,208 --> 00:54:17,377
Memoirs, dairies,

467
00:54:17,411 --> 00:54:19,613
anything that really belonged
to the Helwigs.

468
00:54:31,992 --> 00:54:33,795
Oh, fuck a duck.

469
00:54:33,828 --> 00:54:34,863
You got your Zippo?

470
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:36,296
Yeah, upstairs.

471
00:55:08,329 --> 00:55:09,565
Studying German?

472
00:55:25,048 --> 00:55:26,917
You sure there isn't anything
you wanna tell me?

473
00:55:37,627 --> 00:55:39,029
Is anyone down there?

474
00:55:39,062 --> 00:55:40,362
What's up?

475
00:55:40,397 --> 00:55:41,765
Get your asses up here now!

476
00:55:41,798 --> 00:55:43,332
This isn't real!
This isn't real!

477
00:55:43,365 --> 00:55:44,969
This isn't real!
This isn't real!

478
00:55:45,002 --> 00:55:46,571
This isn't real!
This isn't real!

479
00:55:46,604 --> 00:55:47,905
This isn't real!
This isn't real!

480
00:55:47,939 --> 00:55:49,607
- Where's the damn morphine?
- This isn't real!

481
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,008
- Eugene, morphine!
- This isn't real!

482
00:55:51,042 --> 00:55:52,910
It's in the medical kit.

483
00:55:52,944 --> 00:55:55,680
This isn't real!
It was us! It was us!

484
00:55:55,713 --> 00:55:57,314
It was us! It was us!
It was us!

485
00:55:57,347 --> 00:55:59,249
- What was us? What was us?
- It was us! It was us!

486
00:56:07,492 --> 00:56:08,894
Remember.

487
00:56:30,015 --> 00:56:31,382
Come downstairs.

488
00:56:32,852 --> 00:56:33,953
We need to talk.

489
00:56:45,799 --> 00:56:47,734
We're not staying another night.

490
00:56:47,767 --> 00:56:48,902
I'm not saying
we abandon post,

491
00:56:48,935 --> 00:56:50,837
but maybe take a new position
in the woods or something.

492
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:53,973
Just frankly, my dear,
fuck the court-martial.

493
00:56:54,007 --> 00:56:55,842
This place is bad juju.

494
00:57:00,047 --> 00:57:01,649
I think we should give him
a proper burial.

495
00:57:01,682 --> 00:57:03,017
- Oh.
- Send him off to heaven.

496
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:04,084
Or the other place.

497
00:57:04,118 --> 00:57:06,020
Does the journal say
where the bodies are dumped?

498
00:57:07,154 --> 00:57:08,556
Let me see the journal.

499
00:57:16,931 --> 00:57:18,065
I don't understand.

500
00:57:18,098 --> 00:57:19,466
No kidding. It's in German.

501
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:20,969
You could barely order
champagne in Paris.

502
00:57:21,002 --> 00:57:22,771
Does Dieter say
where they put the bodies?

503
00:57:22,804 --> 00:57:24,039
I'll check, okay?

504
00:57:24,072 --> 00:57:26,575
But right now, let's get out
of this house.

505
00:57:26,608 --> 00:57:28,543
And you're all willing
to die in a military prison?

506
00:57:32,147 --> 00:57:33,380
Yes.

507
00:57:36,918 --> 00:57:39,588
I want everyone geared up and
ready to clear out. Double time.

508
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:21,899
All right.

509
00:58:21,932 --> 00:58:23,100
We better get
our stories straight

510
00:58:23,133 --> 00:58:24,835
before we get to base camp.

511
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:27,971
Like, "the German soldiers
burned the castle down."

512
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:31,541
That story ain't gonna
seem so straight

513
00:58:31,575 --> 00:58:33,444
when they find the place
in one piece.

514
00:58:34,145 --> 00:58:35,747
Maybe we should've torched it.

515
00:58:36,648 --> 00:58:37,815
Maybe it wouldn't let us.

516
00:59:20,894 --> 00:59:22,462
Do we keep going?

517
00:59:24,631 --> 00:59:26,666
We could, uh,
flip a coin, I guess.

518
00:59:36,676 --> 00:59:39,546
You guys ever read <i>An
Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge?</i>

519
00:59:39,579 --> 00:59:41,948
The entire story takes place

520
00:59:41,982 --> 00:59:43,850
in the mind of the guy
hanging from a noose?

521
00:59:44,685 --> 00:59:46,153
We're dead.

522
00:59:46,187 --> 00:59:48,756
Heaven fucking sucks.

523
00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:50,057
Unless it's the other place.

524
00:59:52,326 --> 00:59:53,995
Well, that's what
they say, right?

525
00:59:54,762 --> 00:59:55,997
Hell is repetition?

526
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:57,765
You know, most cultures have
a version of hell

527
00:59:57,798 --> 01:00:01,268
where the dead relive their sins
over and over for eternity.

528
01:00:01,302 --> 01:00:02,670
Just trapped in a loop.

529
01:00:31,933 --> 01:00:33,302
This ain't right, man.

530
01:00:36,906 --> 01:00:38,074
Let's just turn around.

531
01:01:20,785 --> 01:01:22,787
I just realized...

532
01:01:22,821 --> 01:01:25,256
I haven't taken a shit
since I can remember.

533
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:27,292
That's a classic pick-up line.

534
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:29,160
Neither have I.

535
01:01:29,994 --> 01:01:31,262
For, like, weeks.

536
01:01:31,296 --> 01:01:32,864
That's not possible, right?

537
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:33,998
No, it's not.

538
01:01:34,699 --> 01:01:37,102
Situation normal, all fucked up.

539
01:01:37,135 --> 01:01:38,336
Snafu, all right.

540
01:01:40,138 --> 01:01:42,740
Okay, I'm just gonna say
what we're all thinking.

541
01:01:42,774 --> 01:01:44,643
If we march tomorrow
and return...

542
01:01:44,677 --> 01:01:45,811
One day at a time.

543
01:01:48,047 --> 01:01:49,615
Like the drunk said.

544
01:03:00,789 --> 01:03:02,157
This ain't right, man.

545
01:03:05,428 --> 01:03:06,895
Let's just turn around.

546
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:39,329
Maybe the compass is broken.

547
01:03:40,129 --> 01:03:41,965
Yeah, map, too.

548
01:03:41,998 --> 01:03:43,434
It won't let us leave.

549
01:03:45,936 --> 01:03:47,171
What if...

550
01:03:47,204 --> 01:03:50,140
What if we gave him a proper
burial and all, like you said?

551
01:03:51,375 --> 01:03:53,043
Did the journal 20
the body dump?

552
01:03:54,812 --> 01:03:56,247
The last page was missing.

553
01:04:06,924 --> 01:04:08,994
We need to communicate
with the spirits.

554
01:04:09,027 --> 01:04:11,196
Find out where the remains are.

555
01:04:11,229 --> 01:04:13,265
Are you baking them a cake?

556
01:04:13,298 --> 01:04:15,967
Footsteps.
I want to see where they go.

557
01:04:20,005 --> 01:04:22,240
<i>Vetrulek.</i>

558
01:04:22,274 --> 01:04:23,375
Where'd you hear that word?

559
01:04:24,109 --> 01:04:25,143
Hmm?

560
01:04:25,176 --> 01:04:26,211
<i>Vetrulek?</i>

561
01:04:26,244 --> 01:04:27,812
It's just something
that's been...

562
01:04:29,582 --> 01:04:31,517
...floating around my head.

563
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:33,119
Triple word score on that one.

564
01:04:33,152 --> 01:04:34,854
No, Dieter mentions that word.

565
01:04:34,887 --> 01:04:36,956
It's an old Muslim belief.

566
01:04:36,989 --> 01:04:41,495
Uh, "If you let evil happen,
it could come back to haunt you tenfold."

567
01:04:41,528 --> 01:04:44,897
Like all that's required for evil
to triumph is a good man do nothing.

568
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:47,133
Yeah, but more like a curse.

569
01:04:47,166 --> 01:04:48,968
Why would Tappert
know that word?

570
01:06:20,163 --> 01:06:21,965
What do you want?

571
01:06:23,199 --> 01:06:25,001
Guys, help!

572
01:06:30,641 --> 01:06:32,309
Guys, help!

573
01:06:33,445 --> 01:06:34,713
Shoot her!

574
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:38,015
Fucking shoot her!

575
01:06:38,048 --> 01:06:39,116
Help! Help!

576
01:06:41,453 --> 01:06:43,387
- Shoot her!
- Shoot what?

577
01:06:47,324 --> 01:06:48,359
Shoot her!

578
01:06:48,392 --> 01:06:49,994
Fucking shoot her!

579
01:06:58,136 --> 01:06:59,204
No!

580
01:07:09,281 --> 01:07:10,315
Flank left!

581
01:07:11,416 --> 01:07:12,685
Chris, we're coming in!

582
01:07:12,718 --> 01:07:14,487
One, two, three!

583
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:52,484
They're here.

584
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:15,508
What is it?

585
01:08:16,742 --> 01:08:18,444
It's the last page
of the journal.

586
01:09:32,322 --> 01:09:34,024
Done.

587
01:09:34,057 --> 01:09:35,191
We should pray or something.

588
01:09:38,061 --> 01:09:39,896
This makes no sense.

589
01:09:39,929 --> 01:09:41,264
What?

590
01:09:41,297 --> 01:09:44,067
The Helwigs weren't French,
they were Afghans.

591
01:09:47,171 --> 01:09:50,174
Yeah, this family,
they hid dozens of Jews in the walls here,

592
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:52,943
and spent a fortune providing
them safe passage to America.

593
01:09:55,046 --> 01:09:59,083
They risked their lives collaborating against
the Nazis for as long as they could.

594
01:09:59,116 --> 01:10:00,550
Since when do you know Arabic?

595
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,621
What else does it say?

596
01:10:04,654 --> 01:10:07,892
Uh, just before she died, Mrs.
Helwig performed the <i>vetrul</i> curse

597
01:10:07,925 --> 01:10:10,162
against the men who just
stood by and watched.

598
01:10:10,195 --> 01:10:12,230
Just haunting them to the grave.

599
01:10:12,264 --> 01:10:15,200
Can we just focus on one
fucking thing for two seconds?

600
01:10:17,936 --> 01:10:18,937
Let's finish it.

601
01:10:26,878 --> 01:10:28,113
Ashes to ashes,

602
01:10:28,813 --> 01:10:30,848
dust to dust.

603
01:10:30,882 --> 01:10:33,286
As I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

604
01:10:33,319 --> 01:10:34,854
I fear no evil...

605
01:10:39,025 --> 01:10:42,161
Court-martial my ass for all I
care, as long as it's not here.

606
01:10:42,195 --> 01:10:43,329
Amen to that.

607
01:10:44,363 --> 01:10:46,165
Hey, give me a hand with this.

608
01:10:52,004 --> 01:10:53,973
Whoa! Slowly.

609
01:10:54,006 --> 01:10:55,041
Could be booby-trapped.

610
01:11:07,687 --> 01:11:08,688
Cigars?

611
01:11:09,289 --> 01:11:10,756
Locked in a trunk?

612
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:12,059
Gotta be worth something.

613
01:11:12,092 --> 01:11:13,961
Whatever.
Let's clear out in five.

614
01:11:14,827 --> 01:11:16,396
Hold on a second.

615
01:11:16,430 --> 01:11:19,433
Dieter mentions something
about a trunk in his last entry,

616
01:11:19,466 --> 01:11:21,870
and once the Nazis opened it,
his entries stopped.

617
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:29,210
- What now?
- It's, like, some of the words are different.

618
01:11:29,244 --> 01:11:31,045
Like, it...
It says something new.

619
01:11:31,079 --> 01:11:32,347
What?

620
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:34,449
That interring them
only gave them power.

621
01:11:36,817 --> 01:11:37,818
Power for what?

622
01:11:43,258 --> 01:11:45,961
Power to bring
them back from the dead.

623
01:11:59,508 --> 01:12:00,708
Break's over.

624
01:12:52,263 --> 01:12:57,502
This isn't real!
This isn't real!

625
01:13:02,574 --> 01:13:03,976
Get off of me.

626
01:13:04,009 --> 01:13:06,912
Remember!

627
01:13:09,381 --> 01:13:11,049
Remember!

628
01:13:11,083 --> 01:13:12,817
This isn't real! This isn't real!
This isn't real!

629
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:13,885
This isn't real!

630
01:13:13,919 --> 01:13:14,987
This isn't real!

631
01:13:20,493 --> 01:13:21,527
Easy, son.

632
01:13:22,228 --> 01:13:23,296
Take it easy.

633
01:13:24,464 --> 01:13:25,831
It's all right.

634
01:13:26,366 --> 01:13:27,367
Relax.

635
01:13:32,572 --> 01:13:34,540
Two...

636
01:13:34,574 --> 01:13:35,774
Hold him down.

637
01:13:38,578 --> 01:13:39,946
Easy.

638
01:13:42,315 --> 01:13:43,449
Get away!

639
01:13:43,483 --> 01:13:45,119
Back off! Back off!

640
01:13:45,152 --> 01:13:46,587
- Get a grip. You stand down!
- Get away!

641
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:47,888
Stand down, son!

642
01:13:47,921 --> 01:13:50,324
Son, before you hurt someone,

643
01:13:50,357 --> 01:13:51,525
give me that.

644
01:13:51,558 --> 01:13:52,526
Ann, you pull him out.

645
01:13:52,559 --> 01:13:54,895
I don't want him going
under like that again.

646
01:14:08,376 --> 01:14:09,978
Don't worry if you
can't remember anything.

647
01:14:10,011 --> 01:14:11,046
That'll pass shortly.

648
01:14:13,882 --> 01:14:14,848
Where am I?

649
01:14:14,883 --> 01:14:16,951
You were flown to a special
off-book facility.

650
01:14:16,985 --> 01:14:18,953
You remember your last day
in Afghanistan, Lieutenant?

651
01:14:22,023 --> 01:14:23,358
Give it a sec.
It'll come to you.

652
01:14:31,466 --> 01:14:32,935
Let's move!

653
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:44,547
What's the situation?

654
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:47,483
The asset's the blue-chip doctor
for Islamic state's top brass.

655
01:14:47,516 --> 01:14:49,318
- Co-operating?
- Yeah.

656
01:14:49,352 --> 01:14:51,987
Fed us sight intel on the
last four high-value kills.

657
01:14:52,021 --> 01:14:54,957
Put his entire family at risk to help
us, but he's been blown.

658
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:56,259
Go for sent comm.

659
01:14:56,293 --> 01:14:57,461
So it's an extraction?

660
01:14:59,229 --> 01:15:02,065
The plan is to get his family
to a safe house in Kabul,

661
01:15:02,099 --> 01:15:05,569
but there goes our information pipeline.
Copy that.

662
01:15:14,411 --> 01:15:16,413
All the injuries to your squad
were extreme.

663
01:15:20,618 --> 01:15:23,921
You were far too critical
for the Kandahar trauma center.

664
01:15:23,955 --> 01:15:26,023
The mind is a very powerful
healing tool,

665
01:15:26,057 --> 01:15:28,259
but when pressed by
the awareness of paralysis

666
01:15:28,292 --> 01:15:32,029
and amputation, it can
simply shut down and die.

667
01:15:33,498 --> 01:15:36,634
Our computer simulation
is designed to help soldiers

668
01:15:36,667 --> 01:15:38,436
recover from their
post-traumatic stress

669
01:15:38,469 --> 01:15:40,138
as they heal
from their injuries.

670
01:15:40,571 --> 01:15:41,572
Where's Butchie?

671
01:15:42,473 --> 01:15:43,608
Why can't I remember?

672
01:15:43,641 --> 01:15:45,377
I'm sorry.

673
01:15:45,411 --> 01:15:47,012
It's not supposed
to happen like this.

674
01:15:47,446 --> 01:15:48,447
Like what?

675
01:15:59,358 --> 01:16:00,359
Okay.

676
01:16:02,661 --> 01:16:04,229
Playing cat's cradle, huh?

677
01:16:06,165 --> 01:16:08,201
You see this?

678
01:16:08,234 --> 01:16:10,203
I was going to give this
to my boy. You want it?

679
01:16:10,236 --> 01:16:12,238
Your hands are tied.
You want that?

680
01:16:12,272 --> 01:16:13,306
There.

681
01:16:23,583 --> 01:16:24,751
Hey, Paul.

682
01:16:24,784 --> 01:16:27,253
- <i>As-Salaam-Alaikum.</i>
- <i>Wa-Salaam-Alaikum,</i> Paul.

683
01:16:27,287 --> 01:16:28,488
Please join us.

684
01:16:30,356 --> 01:16:31,357
Doctor.

685
01:16:35,696 --> 01:16:36,831
Is this everyone?

686
01:16:36,864 --> 01:16:39,600
Yellow-six, stand by with the van.

687
01:16:39,633 --> 01:16:40,668
What's wrong?

688
01:16:40,701 --> 01:16:43,137
That day we hoped
would never come?

689
01:16:43,170 --> 01:16:45,439
Your name keeps coming up
on the cyber chatter.

690
01:16:45,473 --> 01:16:46,507
What? What happened?

691
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:48,409
You promised to protect us!

692
01:16:48,442 --> 01:16:51,645
I know, and I'm sorry, but look,
you don't even have time to pack.

693
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:52,847
Just get your children,

694
01:16:52,881 --> 01:16:55,449
get your passports and meet
us outside in two minutes.

695
01:16:55,483 --> 01:16:57,486
- Let's move.
- <i>Echo 11, abort mission.</i>

696
01:16:57,519 --> 01:16:59,354
- What?
- <i>Got three incoming land bogeys</i>

697
01:16:59,387 --> 01:17:00,722
<i>cutting off all major arteries.</i>

698
01:17:00,755 --> 01:17:03,525
<i>You got about
30 seconds to find cover.</i>

699
01:17:03,558 --> 01:17:05,327
Command jacked
into NATO satellite,

700
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,195
ISIS forces are coming
in from all sides.

701
01:17:07,229 --> 01:17:08,330
Three vehicles.

702
01:17:09,564 --> 01:17:10,665
Put us in the wall.

703
01:17:10,699 --> 01:17:11,733
What?

704
01:17:11,766 --> 01:17:12,935
ISIS is coming,

705
01:17:12,969 --> 01:17:15,303
and they're blocking our escape.
Put us in the wall.

706
01:17:16,838 --> 01:17:19,274
- Hide.
- Come, please. It is this way.

707
01:17:19,307 --> 01:17:20,343
Here, here, here.

708
01:17:20,376 --> 01:17:21,377
Cristina!

709
01:17:25,381 --> 01:17:26,382
Inside!

710
01:17:27,183 --> 01:17:28,184
Keep dreaming, man.

711
01:17:29,118 --> 01:17:31,053
Extraction is now impossible.

712
01:17:31,087 --> 01:17:34,190
We wait for the hajis and let the
drones track 'em back to the big brass.

713
01:17:34,223 --> 01:17:37,093
CDE can put eyes,
we're ahead in five.

714
01:17:37,126 --> 01:17:38,828
- Move!
- Fuck that, I'm not going in there.

715
01:17:38,861 --> 01:17:41,297
You don't have a goddamn
opinion until I give you one!

716
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:42,498
What about
protecting the family?

717
01:17:42,532 --> 01:17:45,102
Get in the fucking wall! Now!

718
01:17:46,403 --> 01:17:47,404
Fuck.

719
01:17:49,406 --> 01:17:51,775
Come on. Come on.
You have to hide.

720
01:17:52,476 --> 01:17:53,477
Come on.

721
01:17:54,478 --> 01:17:55,646
Get in! Go!

722
01:18:35,354 --> 01:18:36,355
Shh.

723
01:20:54,966 --> 01:20:56,468
You're done.

724
01:22:32,902 --> 01:22:35,470
Drones are locked.
Nobody move.

725
01:22:39,775 --> 01:22:41,343
See you at my court-martial.

726
01:22:57,127 --> 01:22:58,661
We were never here.

727
01:23:00,864 --> 01:23:03,533
With all respect,
fuck you, sir.

728
01:23:09,439 --> 01:23:12,642
You got eyes on 'em?
Do not lose them.

729
01:23:23,754 --> 01:23:25,957
Bomb!

730
01:23:43,875 --> 01:23:47,846
Oh, God. Oh, God.

731
01:23:47,879 --> 01:23:51,083
We should have helped them. We could
have saved them before it was too late.

732
01:23:51,117 --> 01:23:52,919
And what about this guys,
they're still in France?

733
01:23:52,952 --> 01:23:55,087
Why did you guys put us
in a fucking war at all?

734
01:23:55,121 --> 01:23:57,622
World War II scenario has been
the most effective for linking

735
01:23:57,656 --> 01:23:59,992
like-minded soldiers
with purpose, with brotherhood.

736
01:24:00,026 --> 01:24:02,460
something the sim
just can't create by itself.

737
01:24:02,494 --> 01:24:05,164
For six weeks,
you all were thriving.

738
01:24:05,197 --> 01:24:09,869
Making miraculous recoveries, despite
your conditions, especially in the mind.

739
01:24:09,903 --> 01:24:13,873
A few days ago, Butchie Martinsen
woke from an induced coma

740
01:24:13,907 --> 01:24:15,943
for reasons we don't understand.

741
01:24:15,976 --> 01:24:20,780
And when he saw his body,
he just simply shut his eyes and he died.

742
01:24:21,681 --> 01:24:23,016
Which he tried to tell us.

743
01:24:23,984 --> 01:24:25,118
This isn't real.

744
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:28,956
- Phantom itch.
- You have an itch?

745
01:24:28,989 --> 01:24:30,090
No, in the sim.

746
01:24:30,123 --> 01:24:32,859
Kirk was always
scratching his feet.

747
01:24:32,894 --> 01:24:37,531
And the Morse Code we heard,
was a message from... us.

748
01:24:37,564 --> 01:24:39,133
"I have no legs."

749
01:24:39,167 --> 01:24:42,602
That was our subconscious mind telling
us what we couldn't see for ourselves.

750
01:24:42,636 --> 01:24:47,241
And, "you leave, you die." Not a
threat but a warning about the sim.

751
01:24:47,275 --> 01:24:50,044
You sent subliminal messages
to yourself, that's...

752
01:24:51,312 --> 01:24:53,680
- That's incredible.
- Yeah, and dangerous.

753
01:24:53,714 --> 01:24:54,983
There's gotta be a way
to shut that down.

754
01:24:56,018 --> 01:24:57,819
More CTZ to the frontal lobe.

755
01:25:07,062 --> 01:25:08,529
Your sim is haunted, you know.

756
01:25:09,797 --> 01:25:11,100
There's a ghost in the machine.

757
01:25:11,133 --> 01:25:14,136
Or a computer virus,
or a programmer with a fuck ton of issues,

758
01:25:14,169 --> 01:25:16,604
unless it's supposed to feel
like you're in a horror movie.

759
01:25:16,637 --> 01:25:19,808
- How so?
- That's not part of the program?

760
01:25:19,842 --> 01:25:22,644
Sticking in avatars of
previously engaged combatants?

761
01:25:22,678 --> 01:25:24,747
- Reliving old missions?
- God, no.

762
01:25:25,982 --> 01:25:27,549
The simulation is meant
to be benign.

763
01:25:27,583 --> 01:25:31,287
World War II was chosen because it
would trigger fewer real-world memories.

764
01:25:31,321 --> 01:25:32,755
What about the word
"vetrulek"?

765
01:25:35,091 --> 01:25:36,192
What?

766
01:25:36,226 --> 01:25:39,929
You all whispered that word
at one time or another.

767
01:25:39,963 --> 01:25:43,066
The Internet says
it's a Muslim curse.

768
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:04,654
What the hell is that?

769
01:26:11,063 --> 01:26:12,964
We brought the Helwigs
into the sim with us.

770
01:26:19,703 --> 01:26:20,972
We brought them to life,
gave them power.

771
01:26:22,074 --> 01:26:24,176
But the program...
None of it's real.

772
01:26:24,209 --> 01:26:26,011
It's real when you're
fucking in it!

773
01:26:26,044 --> 01:26:27,312
The prayers, everything.

774
01:26:32,385 --> 01:26:36,055
Get an evac team down here
immediately.

775
01:26:36,089 --> 01:26:38,958
- You gotta put me back in there.
- No, I'm gonna sedate them.

776
01:26:38,991 --> 01:26:42,128
- 20mls Propofol.
- Put me back in, I can save them.

777
01:26:42,161 --> 01:26:45,797
We were blind to what we did to them.
They tried to show us but we couldn't see.

778
01:26:45,831 --> 01:26:50,069
Just look for yourself. Were my memories
in Afghanistan supposed to be there?

779
01:26:51,270 --> 01:26:53,172
Okay, I'll put you back.

780
01:26:53,206 --> 01:26:55,641
- But what will you do?
- We need to face what we did.

781
01:26:55,675 --> 01:26:57,710
Atone for our sins
before it's too late.

782
01:26:59,980 --> 01:27:00,981
Do it.

783
01:27:02,049 --> 01:27:03,850
Okay.

784
01:27:03,883 --> 01:27:05,953
<i>Initiating promotion
sequence.</i>

785
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:09,022
<i>Simulator engaged.</i>

786
01:27:10,324 --> 01:27:12,059
<i>Memory suppression complete.</i>

787
01:27:12,092 --> 01:27:14,228
- Wait, Chris!
- <i>In 10...</i>

788
01:27:14,261 --> 01:27:16,629
- <i>Your memory will be wiped.</i>
