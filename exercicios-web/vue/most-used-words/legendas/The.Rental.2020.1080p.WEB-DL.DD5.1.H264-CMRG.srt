00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,819
Whoa.

3
00:01:09,687 --> 00:01:10,555
Oh my God.

4
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:13,490
It's beautiful.

5
00:01:14,626 --> 00:01:16,728
Oh this is just what
I need right now.

6
00:01:16,761 --> 00:01:19,797
And look at the
fucking coastline.

7
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:21,833
Oh, I want it now.

8
00:01:21,866 --> 00:01:24,869
Well, it's available
this weekend.

9
00:01:26,638 --> 00:01:28,472
Oh, maybe that's why.

10
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,375
Shit, is that per night?
Whoa.

11
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,480
Fuck it.

12
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,181
You need it.

13
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:40,785
Yo.

14
00:01:40,818 --> 00:01:42,787
Oh hey.
Hi.

15
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,287
Hey, sorry am I interrupting?

16
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:46,390
No, to at all.
My baby.

17
00:01:46,423 --> 00:01:47,558
What's up bro?

18
00:01:47,592 --> 00:01:48,660
Hey, man nothing,

19
00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:51,194
I was just dropping off
someone in the neighborhood,

20
00:01:51,228 --> 00:01:53,631
thought I'd pop in, see
if you needed a ride home.

21
00:01:53,665 --> 00:01:55,600
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

22
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:56,968
Yeah, we're just about finished.

23
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:58,569
Does she request you on the app

24
00:01:58,603 --> 00:01:59,637
or can you go rogue?

25
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:03,407
I think we'll get away
with it, this time, yeah.

26
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,676
What you guys looking at?

27
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:06,209
This house on the coast,

28
00:02:06,243 --> 00:02:07,177
we figured it might be fun

29
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,046
if the four of us took
a trip this weekend,

30
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:10,280
celebrate the closing
of seat funding.

31
00:02:10,313 --> 00:02:11,448
It's gonna be a
shit ton of work,

32
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:13,651
so we figured it'll be nice
to take a little vacation

33
00:02:13,685 --> 00:02:14,686
before we start.

34
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:16,253
Yeah, cool.

35
00:02:16,286 --> 00:02:17,755
I'm just gonna grab my jacket.

36
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:18,656
Okay.

37
00:02:21,592 --> 00:02:23,326
Hey, I meant to text you,

38
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,798
congratulations, it's
a really big deal.

39
00:02:26,831 --> 00:02:29,266
Thanks man.
Yeah.

40
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:30,702
Okay, let's hit it.

41
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:32,536
You all set?
Yeah.

42
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,505
All right, I love you bro, bro.

43
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:36,874
Love you more.

44
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:38,475
Goodnight.

45
00:02:38,508 --> 00:02:39,509
Goodnight.

46
00:02:42,714 --> 00:02:44,015
I can't believe I'm
actually looking forward

47
00:02:44,048 --> 00:02:46,316
our a weekend away
with your brother.

48
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:47,985
I'd pretty much given up on him

49
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:50,287
but it really feels
like Mina woke him up.

50
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,689
I don't know.

51
00:02:51,723 --> 00:02:53,658
He actually seems motivated,

52
00:02:53,691 --> 00:02:55,927
he's working, he's
back in school.

53
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,029
I don't know if I'd
call two night classes,

54
00:02:58,062 --> 00:02:59,463
back in school.

55
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:03,467
Well, she's definitely
a positive influence.

56
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,871
Tell me how that
relationship has any legs.

57
00:03:06,904 --> 00:03:08,806
She's, you know, I mean.

58
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,908
She's the whole package.
Right,

59
00:03:10,942 --> 00:03:12,342
and then you have my brother,

60
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:15,312
he's a barely
employed Lyft driver,

61
00:03:15,345 --> 00:03:16,413
got kicked out of college,

62
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,850
served jail time for nearly
beating a guy to death,

63
00:03:18,883 --> 00:03:20,551
outside of his frat house.

64
00:03:20,585 --> 00:03:23,788
I'm just saying, I've
never seen him like this.

65
00:03:23,821 --> 00:03:25,923
He really loves her, it's sweet.

66
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:27,959
Yeah, of course he loves her,

67
00:03:27,992 --> 00:03:30,393
he hit the fucking jackpot.

68
00:03:33,998 --> 00:03:37,034
Oh yeah, it's a juicy one.

69
00:03:37,068 --> 00:03:38,569
Yeah, that's gross.
Look at that,

70
00:03:38,603 --> 00:03:39,436
you want it?

71
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,270
No, I don't want it.

72
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,072
It's yours.
well, I don't want that,

73
00:03:41,105 --> 00:03:41,939
it's yours now.

74
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:43,841
Go on, keep it.
No.

75
00:03:50,114 --> 00:03:52,016
You didn't just do that.

76
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:54,018
Let me see, let me
see your finger.

77
00:03:54,051 --> 00:03:55,753
It's on my finger still.
Let me see your finger,

78
00:03:55,787 --> 00:03:56,921
let me see it.

79
00:03:59,857 --> 00:04:02,059
You fucking kidding me.

80
00:04:02,093 --> 00:04:03,027
Hey.

81
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,629
Dude, they said no pets.

82
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:06,396
Just chill, it's gonna be fine.

83
00:04:06,429 --> 00:04:07,732
No, homeowners don't take

84
00:04:07,765 --> 00:04:09,466
this shit lightly dude,

85
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,735
they'll turn us away.

86
00:04:11,736 --> 00:04:12,536
Oh yeah, it'll be hysterical

87
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,005
when we drive across
the entire state

88
00:04:14,038 --> 00:04:15,006
and have to turn right round.

89
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:15,973
[Josh] Look, we'll hide him

90
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:18,109
until the owners
gone, all right.

91
00:04:18,142 --> 00:04:19,744
It's gonna be fine.

92
00:04:19,777 --> 00:04:20,611
Give him some love.

93
00:04:20,645 --> 00:04:21,746
What, no.
Give him a kiss.

94
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:22,546
No.
You're gonna

95
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,448
make him insecure
man, seriously.

96
00:04:26,383 --> 00:04:27,785
There it is.

97
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:28,953
Good boy, Reg.

98
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:36,761
This seems totally
normal, right?

99
00:04:36,794 --> 00:04:38,428
Yeah.

100
00:04:38,461 --> 00:04:40,131
Nothing that should
set off any red flags.

101
00:04:40,164 --> 00:04:44,467
Except, not everyone
is a racist prick.

102
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:47,537
Mina, how many places
have you booked through?

103
00:04:47,572 --> 00:04:49,406
One.
Okay, well there you go.

104
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:51,042
Yeah, but she got
a five star rating.

105
00:04:51,075 --> 00:04:53,911
How many places have we booked?

106
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:54,745
Three.

107
00:04:55,646 --> 00:04:56,479
What?

108
00:04:56,513 --> 00:04:57,480
It's still more than one.

109
00:04:57,514 --> 00:05:00,017
Oh, come on, it's the
same house, same dates,

110
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:01,118
her request gets denied

111
00:05:01,152 --> 00:05:03,754
and yours gets
accepted an hour later.

112
00:05:03,788 --> 00:05:05,522
Look, discrimination
obviously exists,

113
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:06,991
and the name Mina Mohamadi,

114
00:05:07,024 --> 00:05:09,126
is about as Middle
Eastern, as it gets.

115
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,962
I'm just saying,
why jump to that

116
00:05:10,995 --> 00:05:12,930
as the only possible
explanation.

117
00:05:12,964 --> 00:05:14,899
Yeah, no, you're right.

118
00:05:14,932 --> 00:05:16,734
We should probably give, this
white guy we've never met,

119
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:17,702
the benefit of the doubt.

120
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:19,103
Give everybody the
benefit of the doubt,

121
00:05:19,136 --> 00:05:20,037
is what I'm saying.

122
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:22,907
Yeah, no, that's groovy man,

123
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,975
peace and love.

124
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:04,815
Shit, are we here?

125
00:06:04,849 --> 00:06:06,984
Looks like it.

126
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:09,954
Will you hide your dog.

127
00:06:11,055 --> 00:06:12,890
You realize, if he
barks, we are fucked.

128
00:06:12,924 --> 00:06:15,126
He won't make a peak.

129
00:06:37,915 --> 00:06:39,650
Not bad.
So nice.

130
00:06:42,186 --> 00:06:43,721
He's gotta be around
here somewhere.

131
00:06:43,754 --> 00:06:44,622
Hello.

132
00:06:58,269 --> 00:06:59,937
Whoa.
Holy shit.

133
00:07:01,205 --> 00:07:02,940
Oh, yeah, this will do.

134
00:07:03,641 --> 00:07:05,176
Do you have the guys number?

135
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:06,210
Yes, here.

136
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:15,619
Oh, hey.

137
00:07:15,653 --> 00:07:17,188
Y'all just decided to
let yourselves in, hah?

138
00:07:17,221 --> 00:07:18,189
Sorry, I was just
trying to call you.

139
00:07:19,724 --> 00:07:21,659
Yeah, I expected
you an hour ago.

140
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:22,660
Is everything okay?

141
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,695
Yeah, we just, we got
a bit of a late start

142
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:26,597
and then stopped for groceries.

143
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,032
You must be Taylor, I'm Charlie.

144
00:07:28,065 --> 00:07:29,100
Yeah, that's me.

145
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:30,935
You own this place?

146
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:33,738
Why do you gotta
say it like that?

147
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:36,040
Oh, I didn't mean
anything by it.

148
00:07:36,073 --> 00:07:37,842
Yeah, it's my brothers spot,

149
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,043
I just take care of it,

150
00:07:39,076 --> 00:07:40,244
he's down in the Bay area,

151
00:07:40,277 --> 00:07:42,046
he never uses it.

152
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,214
Well, we're hopefully on our way

153
00:07:43,247 --> 00:07:47,118
to owning a second
home, we never use, too.

154
00:07:47,151 --> 00:07:49,053
This is my wife Michelle,

155
00:07:49,086 --> 00:07:50,588
that's my brother Josh

156
00:07:50,621 --> 00:07:51,756
and my partner Mina,

157
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:55,292
my work partner, also happens
to be Josh's girlfriend.

158
00:07:55,326 --> 00:07:58,929
How'd you get mixed
up with this family?

159
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:03,868
What do you mean?

160
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:06,704
Oh, no, I didn't
mean anything by it.

161
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:10,207
Come on, let me show
you rest of the house.

162
00:08:12,943 --> 00:08:15,946
Wow, this piece of shit,

163
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,749
somehow exceeded
my expectations.

164
00:08:18,783 --> 00:08:21,585
Yeah, no that's, fucking weird.

165
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,589
Can't believe we're
giving this guy our money.

166
00:08:25,623 --> 00:08:27,758
- Babe.
- What?

167
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:30,828
Let's just, look
we already drove,

168
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:32,263
all the way out here all right,

169
00:08:32,296 --> 00:08:34,065
let's just enjoy ourselves,

170
00:08:34,098 --> 00:08:35,733
spend some time together

171
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:38,102
and be outta here soon, okay.

172
00:08:50,815 --> 00:08:52,283
All right, set to
blank, turn that thing

173
00:08:52,316 --> 00:08:53,217
and let me show you.

174
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,852
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

175
00:08:54,885 --> 00:08:56,053
Let me show you out back

176
00:08:56,087 --> 00:08:58,222
and then I'll get
outta your hair.

177
00:08:58,255 --> 00:08:59,924
Great.

178
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:05,029
Wow, it's beautiful.

179
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:09,967
Yeah, that's the thing, ocean.

180
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,970
The hot tub's over here.

181
00:09:16,674 --> 00:09:18,676
Instructions are on the side.

182
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:20,845
There's a bathroom
through that door,

183
00:09:20,878 --> 00:09:22,213
on the corner there,

184
00:09:22,246 --> 00:09:24,248
towels, everything you need.

185
00:09:24,281 --> 00:09:26,350
- Oh nice.
- Great.

186
00:09:26,383 --> 00:09:29,420
Yeah, it's nice
getting in after dark,

187
00:09:29,453 --> 00:09:32,389
the stars are insane out here.

188
00:09:32,423 --> 00:09:34,825
Damn, I shoulda
brought the telescope.

189
00:09:34,859 --> 00:09:37,194
I thought about it
and I totally forgot.

190
00:09:37,228 --> 00:09:40,164
What do you need a
telescope in the city for?

191
00:09:40,197 --> 00:09:44,135
Unless you're like a
peeping tom or something.

192
00:09:48,706 --> 00:09:49,473
I got one you can borrow.

193
00:09:49,507 --> 00:09:50,808
If you promise to
treat it right,

194
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:52,376
I'll bring it on over.

195
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:54,411
Oh, that's all right, I
don't wanna put you out.

196
00:09:54,445 --> 00:09:56,213
No, that's no problem.

197
00:09:56,247 --> 00:09:59,216
I shoulda had one here already.

198
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,718
That's my fault.

199
00:10:06,157 --> 00:10:08,459
All right then, I'll
let you get to it.

200
00:10:08,492 --> 00:10:10,361
There's a welcome pack
in the loft upstairs,

201
00:10:10,394 --> 00:10:13,330
you got my phone
number, wifi info such,

202
00:10:13,364 --> 00:10:14,398
I'm just up the road,

203
00:10:14,431 --> 00:10:16,267
if you need anything.

204
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,770
Otherwise, follow the check
out procedures, when you go,

205
00:10:19,803 --> 00:10:22,806
and have a good,
have a good weekend.

206
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,507
All right.
Thanks.

207
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:24,742
Really appreciate it, thank you.

208
00:10:24,775 --> 00:10:25,843
All right.
Hey dude,

209
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:29,980
are you the one who does
the bookings for this place?

210
00:10:31,415 --> 00:10:32,917
Yeah, I book this place.

211
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,051
I tried to rent this house,

212
00:10:34,084 --> 00:10:35,452
for this exact period of time,

213
00:10:35,486 --> 00:10:36,921
but my request was denied,

214
00:10:36,954 --> 00:10:38,822
can you tell me why that is?

215
00:10:38,856 --> 00:10:41,325
I don't know, a lot of people
try to rent this place,

216
00:10:41,358 --> 00:10:43,894
I don't remember your request.
Yeah, babe.

217
00:10:43,928 --> 00:10:44,795
It's just a little strange,

218
00:10:44,828 --> 00:10:46,397
'cause my request was denied

219
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,798
but then Charlie, a white man,

220
00:10:47,831 --> 00:10:49,366
put in an identical request,

221
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,202
an hour later and
his was accepted.

222
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:53,070
We really don't have to
get into this, right now.

223
00:10:53,103 --> 00:10:56,173
Mina Mohamadi, do
you remember now?

224
00:10:58,842 --> 00:10:59,977
If you don't like the house,

225
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,111
or have any other problems,

226
00:11:01,145 --> 00:11:05,883
cancellation policy is listed
clearly on the website.

227
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,986
Outside of that, I
don't have anything else

228
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:10,754
to discuss with you.

229
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:15,826
We understand, thank you.

230
00:11:17,861 --> 00:11:19,196
Asshole.
Hey.

231
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:26,770
Wanna help me put
away the groceries?

232
00:11:26,804 --> 00:11:27,471
Yeah.

233
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:08,245
It's a beautiful home,

234
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:09,413
hah, bro, bro?

235
00:12:10,582 --> 00:12:13,517
Crack a bruskey or twosky,

236
00:12:13,551 --> 00:12:15,786
gaze up at brorians belt.

237
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:19,823
Sip a little Pinot gris,

238
00:12:20,524 --> 00:12:23,027
pop in a bromantic comedy.

239
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:26,263
Oh, Broseph Gordon-Levitt
all day, all night.

240
00:12:26,297 --> 00:12:28,499
Smoke a J, take a long walk

241
00:12:28,532 --> 00:12:30,367
along the brocean.

242
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:32,369
Yeah, get that sand
between your broes.

243
00:12:32,403 --> 00:12:33,470
Prefect brome away from brome.

244
00:12:34,371 --> 00:12:36,240
Okay, that's enough.

245
00:12:38,442 --> 00:12:40,010
A walk does sound nice though.

246
00:12:40,044 --> 00:12:40,911
I wasn't kidding about that.

247
00:12:40,944 --> 00:12:41,812
After we put the stuff away,

248
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,480
you guys wanna check
out the property?

249
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:45,249
Abs-bro-lutely.

250
00:12:45,282 --> 00:12:48,620
Oh shit, Michelle,
from way down town.

251
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:51,889
Come on.

252
00:13:51,949 --> 00:13:52,617
Shit.

253
00:13:54,284 --> 00:13:55,119
Come on.

254
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:56,887
Come on.

255
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:44,968
What you doing boy?
Jesus.

256
00:14:45,002 --> 00:14:46,336
God, that was good.

257
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,504
What the fuck?

258
00:14:48,606 --> 00:14:53,076
Creepy door with an
electronic code, that's great.

259
00:14:59,283 --> 00:15:01,218
Would have been extra
creepy if that worked.

260
00:15:01,251 --> 00:15:02,486
So dumb.

261
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:05,657
Come on, they're waiting.
All right.

262
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:17,234
They can be kind
of intense, right.

263
00:15:17,267 --> 00:15:19,036
Yeah.

264
00:15:19,069 --> 00:15:22,172
Don't worry, it gets less weird.

265
00:15:22,206 --> 00:15:24,074
That's comforting.

266
00:15:31,315 --> 00:15:35,452
I'm constantly terrified,
she's gonna leave me.

267
00:15:35,486 --> 00:15:37,555
Why would you say that?

268
00:15:39,156 --> 00:15:42,159
She's just so fucking smart

269
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:43,595
and talented.

270
00:15:43,628 --> 00:15:46,564
And, you know, I just
wanna be better for her

271
00:15:46,598 --> 00:15:51,168
and I wanna be able to
challenge and inspire her

272
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:55,539
but, I feel like, she doesn't
even need that from me,

273
00:15:56,808 --> 00:16:00,010
she's already
fulfilled in that way.

274
00:16:00,678 --> 00:16:01,779
Makes any sense?

275
00:16:01,813 --> 00:16:03,480
Yeah, absolutely.

276
00:16:04,749 --> 00:16:07,484
Trust me, I hear
everything you're saying

277
00:16:07,518 --> 00:16:10,688
and I think, what
she needs from you

278
00:16:10,722 --> 00:16:14,358
is not for you to
occupy the same space

279
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:16,493
as her work partner,

280
00:16:16,527 --> 00:16:18,529
that's all he is to her.

281
00:16:19,764 --> 00:16:20,598
And I just think,

282
00:16:20,632 --> 00:16:23,367
you need to be loving
and supportive,

283
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,270
goes a lot further
than you think.

284
00:16:26,303 --> 00:16:28,205
All right, so, you're cool

285
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:30,340
with her occupying
such a huge space

286
00:16:30,374 --> 00:16:32,442
in your husband's life?

287
00:16:32,476 --> 00:16:35,078
I mean, no, fuck her.

288
00:16:35,112 --> 00:16:36,446
But yeah, yeah,

289
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,483
they just have their
creative thing going on.

290
00:16:39,516 --> 00:16:43,186
I'm glad he has someone
to share that with.

291
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,827
- Hey.
- I'm freezing.

292
00:16:49,861 --> 00:16:52,564
You guys ready to turn back?

293
00:16:52,597 --> 00:16:53,731
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

294
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,606
Chilly.

295
00:17:17,855 --> 00:17:21,291
Whoa, look what we have here.

296
00:17:21,325 --> 00:17:23,527
Someones trying to get
a five star rating.

297
00:17:23,561 --> 00:17:24,428
Oh, ooh.

298
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,465
All right, I know we
don't like the guy

299
00:17:28,498 --> 00:17:30,768
but I'm glad that we have
this for the weekend.

300
00:17:30,802 --> 00:17:31,669
Yeah.

301
00:17:34,271 --> 00:17:35,505
So, are you really
just accepting

302
00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:38,375
that he's gonna come
and go as he pleases?

303
00:17:38,408 --> 00:17:40,912
Well, you know, he did say,

304
00:17:40,945 --> 00:17:43,815
he was gonna drop
it off, tonight.

305
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:49,152
Couldn't leave it
on the front porch?

306
00:17:49,186 --> 00:17:52,389
You guys don't find
this creepy at all?

307
00:17:56,828 --> 00:17:57,929
Sorry.

308
00:17:57,962 --> 00:17:59,831
Done talking about it.

309
00:18:01,264 --> 00:18:03,200
Let's have a good time.

310
00:18:04,468 --> 00:18:05,502
Who wants a drink?

311
00:18:05,535 --> 00:18:06,771
Yes.

312
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,849
This looks incredible.

313
00:18:17,882 --> 00:18:19,216
Yeah, it's beautiful.

314
00:18:19,249 --> 00:18:20,384
So, what?

315
00:18:20,417 --> 00:18:21,919
We'll just like head out,
first thing in the morning?

316
00:18:21,953 --> 00:18:23,487
Yeah, it'll take
at least two hours

317
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,422
to get to the waterfall.

318
00:18:25,455 --> 00:18:27,457
Charlie's been making fun of me

319
00:18:27,491 --> 00:18:29,226
for buying a hydration pack

320
00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:30,595
just for this hike.

321
00:18:30,628 --> 00:18:32,195
It is the nerdiest
thing I've ever seen

322
00:18:32,229 --> 00:18:34,599
but I love you and I
love that you plan ahead.

323
00:18:34,632 --> 00:18:35,900
I get excited.

324
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,737
So, what about tonight?

325
00:18:39,771 --> 00:18:41,673
I mean, I don't know what
kind of vibe we're going for

326
00:18:41,706 --> 00:18:46,376
but, Michelle, don't you have
a little surprise for us?

327
00:18:47,879 --> 00:18:49,212
Tonight?

328
00:18:49,246 --> 00:18:52,249
I was kinda thinking
tomorrow maybe.

329
00:18:53,483 --> 00:18:55,586
Just, let's just show them.

330
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,287
- Just get it.
- Okay.

331
00:18:58,589 --> 00:19:00,424
What's going on?

332
00:19:00,457 --> 00:19:02,259
What are you guys up to?

333
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:04,929
I don't know what's going on.

334
00:19:04,962 --> 00:19:07,932
What are you up to?

335
00:19:07,965 --> 00:19:10,233
Sneaky Michelle.

336
00:19:13,336 --> 00:19:14,237
What?

337
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:17,608
Oh my God.

338
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,410
Oh my God, I don't
think I've done this

339
00:19:20,444 --> 00:19:21,612
since the night we met.

340
00:19:21,646 --> 00:19:23,246
Where did you even get this?

341
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,782
Mina, he's told you the
story of how we met, right?

342
00:19:24,816 --> 00:19:26,651
Yeah, of course, I've
been hearing for years

343
00:19:26,684 --> 00:19:29,854
that you just get a little
ecstasy in this guy,

344
00:19:29,887 --> 00:19:31,521
turns into a dancing queen.

345
00:19:32,355 --> 00:19:32,990
There are pictures
from that night

346
00:19:33,024 --> 00:19:33,958
where it just looks like,

347
00:19:33,991 --> 00:19:37,862
we're full on fucking
on the dance floor.

348
00:19:37,895 --> 00:19:40,430
So, shall we do some drugs?

349
00:19:43,768 --> 00:19:46,838
Shit, you guys, I really
don't wanna be a downer

350
00:19:46,871 --> 00:19:49,574
but I might bow out early.

351
00:19:49,607 --> 00:19:52,710
It just, it was a long
shitty week at work

352
00:19:52,744 --> 00:19:55,947
and I'm sadly fading kinda fast.

353
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,716
Okay, well, you know,
if you're not into it,

354
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,685
we don't have to do
it tonight, right?

355
00:20:00,718 --> 00:20:01,886
Yeah.
Oh my God, no, no, no,

356
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,286
please do it, I'm just,

357
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,056
I know if I keep going,

358
00:20:05,089 --> 00:20:07,792
there's no chance I'm alive
for this hike tomorrow.

359
00:20:07,825 --> 00:20:09,794
Just save enough so we can all

360
00:20:09,827 --> 00:20:13,330
get sufficiently fucked
up tomorrow night.

361
00:20:13,363 --> 00:20:14,565
Yeah, just like a little bit.

362
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:15,733
Yeah.
A little bit.

363
00:20:15,767 --> 00:20:17,334
A little bit.
A little bit.

364
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:45,395
All right, let's go, I got ya.

365
00:20:45,428 --> 00:20:49,000
Tap out, tap out.
Josh, that's enough.

366
00:20:49,033 --> 00:20:50,568
Tap out.

367
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:52,502
Yes, winner.

368
00:20:54,105 --> 00:20:54,972
Yes.

369
00:21:23,134 --> 00:21:24,669
Because of the earth's rotation,

370
00:21:24,702 --> 00:21:26,369
if it had hit a minute later,

371
00:21:26,403 --> 00:21:27,404
it would've landed in the sea

372
00:21:27,437 --> 00:21:31,441
and dinosaurs would still
be ruling our earth.

373
00:21:37,414 --> 00:21:38,583
Do you think cave people

374
00:21:38,616 --> 00:21:40,685
were afraid of asteroids?

375
00:21:43,888 --> 00:21:45,656
Are you saying that 'cause
you think cave people

376
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:48,025
and dinosaurs lived together?

377
00:21:49,459 --> 00:21:52,529
Oh no, I mean, I know
there was, you know,

378
00:21:52,563 --> 00:21:54,565
a time after dinosaurs
before people.

379
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:56,000
How long between
dinosaurs going,

380
00:21:56,033 --> 00:21:57,434
and homo sapiens.
You always do that,

381
00:21:57,467 --> 00:21:58,135
I'm not taking your quiz.

382
00:21:58,169 --> 00:21:59,436
No, come on bro, take a guess.

383
00:21:59,469 --> 00:22:00,671
Fuck you.
65 million years.

384
00:22:00,705 --> 00:22:01,973
Good, you win.

385
00:22:10,681 --> 00:22:12,783
I'm getting another,
you want anything?

386
00:22:12,817 --> 00:22:13,985
I'm fine baby, thank you.

387
00:22:14,018 --> 00:22:15,518
You're good?
Yeah.

388
00:22:15,553 --> 00:22:17,054
What about you Reg

389
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,689
you want anything?

390
00:22:24,161 --> 00:22:26,898
You wanna take a look?
Yeah.

391
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:38,643
What are you doing?

392
00:22:38,676 --> 00:22:41,544
Being one of those
big city peeping toms,

393
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:43,648
people are always talking about.

394
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,652
You see anything?

395
00:22:47,685 --> 00:22:50,420
One house with it's lights on.

396
00:22:51,923 --> 00:22:52,790
Oh yeah.

397
00:22:55,492 --> 00:22:57,028
Are people doing it?

398
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,564
Oh shit.

399
00:23:00,598 --> 00:23:02,033
What?
Somebody was watching,

400
00:23:02,066 --> 00:23:03,634
looking right back at us.

401
00:23:03,668 --> 00:23:04,501
What?

402
00:23:04,534 --> 00:23:05,169
No.

403
00:23:05,202 --> 00:23:07,939
I'm dead serious, look.

404
00:23:10,107 --> 00:23:13,844
Oh my God, is that Taylor?

405
00:23:13,878 --> 00:23:15,146
Okay, the bid is over.

406
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:16,013
What the fuck is he doing?

407
00:23:16,047 --> 00:23:17,214
- Shut up.
- No, I'm serious,

408
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,816
he's got the fuck, fuck.

409
00:23:19,717 --> 00:23:21,152
Fuck you.

410
00:23:21,185 --> 00:23:24,521
Never attempt to
outplay the player.

411
00:23:30,127 --> 00:23:32,730
So glad we did this.

412
00:23:32,763 --> 00:23:34,231
Me too.

413
00:23:35,199 --> 00:23:37,802
It's gonna be a fun year right.

414
00:23:37,835 --> 00:23:39,270
Yeah.

415
00:23:39,303 --> 00:23:42,606
We finally fucking
did it, it's crazy.

416
00:23:53,017 --> 00:23:55,219
I'm gonna go check on Josh.

417
00:24:06,564 --> 00:24:07,231
Oh, hey.

418
00:24:10,034 --> 00:24:10,868
Come back out.

419
00:24:10,901 --> 00:24:12,036
Hey baby.

420
00:24:12,069 --> 00:24:13,771
Don't be in here alone.

421
00:24:13,804 --> 00:24:15,206
It's so comfortable.

422
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:18,676
No, come on, this
is our vacation.

423
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:20,244
We never get to
hang out like this.

424
00:24:20,277 --> 00:24:21,112
I know baby,

425
00:24:21,145 --> 00:24:23,681
I'm coming, I'm coming.

426
00:24:23,714 --> 00:24:25,049
I'm coming.

427
00:24:25,082 --> 00:24:28,252
Why'd you have to drink so much?

428
00:24:28,285 --> 00:24:30,154
Told you to slow down.

429
00:24:44,235 --> 00:24:45,836
Everything okay?

430
00:24:47,071 --> 00:24:48,538
He's like out.

431
00:24:50,207 --> 00:24:52,009
Well, I don't know about you

432
00:24:52,043 --> 00:24:55,246
but I am getting
in this hot tub.

433
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,315
Oh no, I'm like annoyed now.

434
00:24:58,349 --> 00:25:02,753
I just, yeah, maybe I do
wanna get in this hot tub.

435
00:25:05,656 --> 00:25:07,958
I'm getting my suit and
I'll meet you back here.

436
00:25:07,992 --> 00:25:08,859
Okay.

437
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,981
Hydrate.

438
00:25:31,015 --> 00:25:32,349
Hydrate, hydrate.

439
00:25:34,118 --> 00:25:34,952
How is it?

440
00:25:34,985 --> 00:25:36,720
Oh my God, get in.

441
00:25:40,224 --> 00:25:41,092
Oh fuck.

442
00:25:42,293 --> 00:25:43,160
Right?

443
00:25:47,164 --> 00:25:49,166
With the fog rolling in.

444
00:25:50,768 --> 00:25:51,635
So nice.

445
00:25:52,803 --> 00:25:55,206
You know what's really nice?

446
00:25:57,808 --> 00:25:59,677
These jets on my back.

447
00:26:01,145 --> 00:26:02,279
I want jets.

448
00:26:03,781 --> 00:26:05,049
Let me get some.

449
00:26:06,016 --> 00:26:06,884
Trade me.

450
00:26:18,028 --> 00:26:19,697
Oh, this is unreal.

451
00:26:23,234 --> 00:26:25,302
Can I tell you something?

452
00:26:25,336 --> 00:26:29,807
You're getting us a
hot tub for the office?

453
00:26:31,342 --> 00:26:33,744
I think you're brilliant.

454
00:26:35,379 --> 00:26:36,313
Thank you.

455
00:26:36,347 --> 00:26:40,417
You just make me so
much better at what I do

456
00:26:43,187 --> 00:26:45,256
and you're funny and kind

457
00:26:47,892 --> 00:26:49,193
and you're just fucking great,

458
00:26:49,226 --> 00:26:51,095
and I'm just so
happy to know you

459
00:26:51,128 --> 00:26:52,730
and work with you.

460
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:57,401
If you're gonna get
all lovey-dovey,

461
00:26:57,434 --> 00:27:00,037
I feel the same way about you.

462
00:27:01,972 --> 00:27:05,209
I feel like we have
a real partnership,

463
00:27:05,242 --> 00:27:08,913
which I honestly didn't
think was possible.

464
00:27:10,281 --> 00:27:13,384
I always feel like
people let me down.

465
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:18,822
You just keep, not letting
me down, it's weird.

466
00:27:22,293 --> 00:27:23,160
Cheers.

467
00:27:25,062 --> 00:27:26,330
Cheers.

468
00:27:30,367 --> 00:27:31,735
Now, give me those jets back.

469
00:27:31,769 --> 00:27:32,403
No.

470
00:27:34,338 --> 00:27:35,839
Share the jets?

471
00:27:35,873 --> 00:27:37,208
Share the jets.

472
00:27:43,981 --> 00:27:45,182
You getting some?

473
00:27:45,216 --> 00:27:46,083
Yep.

474
00:28:22,453 --> 00:28:23,320
Reggie.

475
00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:26,824
Reggie come here.

476
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:36,033
Whoa.

477
00:28:36,066 --> 00:28:38,135
What the hell was that?

478
00:28:39,403 --> 00:28:40,804
I don't know.

479
00:28:42,273 --> 00:28:45,809
Maybe Reggie has the right idea,

480
00:28:45,843 --> 00:28:47,311
maybe time for bed.

481
00:29:04,629 --> 00:29:06,230
Goodnight Charlie.

482
00:30:44,495 --> 00:30:46,463
The dancing queen lives.

483
00:30:46,497 --> 00:30:47,431
Oh, barely.

484
00:30:47,464 --> 00:30:49,266
You have fun?

485
00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:50,568
Well, come on, we gotta go,

486
00:30:50,602 --> 00:30:52,236
I don't wanna get stuck
out there, in the dark,

487
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:53,605
on the hike back.

488
00:31:02,446 --> 00:31:03,681
Are you going?

489
00:31:05,449 --> 00:31:08,051
Sitting here, trying to decide.

490
00:31:08,085 --> 00:31:10,387
Come on, finish
eating, let's go.

491
00:31:10,421 --> 00:31:15,426
I'm so tired, I don't
think I'll be much fun.

492
00:31:15,693 --> 00:31:17,027
Okay.
What?

493
00:31:20,565 --> 00:31:21,599
Nothing, it's just,

494
00:31:21,633 --> 00:31:24,501
you know, I don't remember
much from last night,

495
00:31:24,535 --> 00:31:26,437
but I do kind of recall,

496
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,472
someone giving me shit

497
00:31:28,505 --> 00:31:32,342
about missing out on
fun vacation times.

498
00:31:32,376 --> 00:31:34,344
You know, something about

499
00:31:34,378 --> 00:31:38,583
how we never get to
hang out this way, or.

500
00:31:38,616 --> 00:31:40,017
Call it even?

501
00:31:41,218 --> 00:31:43,086
You know, I don't have to go,

502
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,189
I can stay here with you.

503
00:31:47,124 --> 00:31:49,059
Can't ditch Michelle,

504
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,262
look how excited she is.

505
00:31:57,167 --> 00:32:01,104
Well, Charlie and her
can have their own day.

506
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,476
Don't think that's happening.

507
00:32:06,477 --> 00:32:07,779
I guess, I'm kinda stuck
with this one, aren't I?

508
00:32:07,812 --> 00:32:11,616
I'm sorry, I'll make
it up to you, promise.

509
00:32:13,818 --> 00:32:17,521
Can have a really fun
night when you get back.

510
00:32:17,555 --> 00:32:19,089
All right.

511
00:32:19,122 --> 00:32:20,692
I love you.

512
00:32:20,725 --> 00:32:22,326
I love you baby.

513
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:26,063
Mina, Charlie let's go,

514
00:32:26,096 --> 00:32:27,599
time to change.

515
00:32:27,632 --> 00:32:28,499
You know what,

516
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:31,636
I think Mina's gonna
sit this one out.

517
00:32:31,669 --> 00:32:35,005
No, really?
I'm hurting pretty bad.

518
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,076
All right, well, it's your loss.

519
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:43,046
Charlie come one,
let's get going.

520
00:32:45,148 --> 00:32:47,084
No, don't give me that.

521
00:32:47,117 --> 00:32:48,653
Come on, let's go.

522
00:32:48,686 --> 00:32:49,687
I'm sorry.

523
00:32:54,157 --> 00:32:55,760
Fine, well, you're
cooking tonight

524
00:32:55,793 --> 00:32:58,328
and I'm getting fucked up.

525
00:32:58,362 --> 00:32:59,429
Yeah, okay.

526
00:33:01,198 --> 00:33:02,533
Josh, you ready?

527
00:33:02,567 --> 00:33:04,167
Yeah, love you.

528
00:33:04,201 --> 00:33:05,670
I love you.

529
00:33:05,703 --> 00:33:07,471
Oh and Reggie's still
tied up out back,

530
00:33:07,504 --> 00:33:09,406
get him later in
case Taylor pops by.

531
00:33:09,439 --> 00:33:11,141
Yeah, I'll grab him, baby.

532
00:33:11,174 --> 00:33:12,610
Thank you.

533
00:33:28,292 --> 00:33:29,459
Are you okay?

534
00:33:31,663 --> 00:33:32,730
Not really.

535
00:33:36,366 --> 00:33:37,501
How you doing?

536
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:48,245
What are you thinking?

537
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:50,414
We're smarter than this.

538
00:33:53,618 --> 00:33:55,319
It can never happen again.

539
00:33:55,352 --> 00:33:56,688
Yeah.

540
00:33:57,855 --> 00:33:58,690
I mean it.

541
00:33:58,723 --> 00:34:00,524
Yeah, I'm with you.

542
00:34:06,631 --> 00:34:09,232
I really do love your brother.

543
00:34:10,768 --> 00:34:12,436
I know.

544
00:34:15,205 --> 00:34:18,375
Anyway, she ended up getting
my number from Charlie

545
00:34:18,408 --> 00:34:21,478
and she texted me the punchline

546
00:34:21,511 --> 00:34:23,681
of this joke that she
had totally butchered,

547
00:34:23,715 --> 00:34:25,482
from the night we met.

548
00:34:25,515 --> 00:34:27,250
That's really cute.

549
00:34:27,284 --> 00:34:28,786
What was the punchline?

550
00:34:29,687 --> 00:34:30,622
Don't make me say it.

551
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,461
You know, you and Charlie,

552
00:34:37,494 --> 00:34:40,430
you guys have like the best,
how did you meet, story.

553
00:34:40,464 --> 00:34:42,600
It is a pretty good one.

554
00:34:43,668 --> 00:34:45,637
Although, I can
think of one person

555
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,504
who thinks otherwise.

556
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:51,743
What do you mean, who?

557
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:54,277
Wait, you know that
when Charlie and I met,

558
00:34:54,311 --> 00:34:56,413
he and Jen were still
together, right?

559
00:34:56,446 --> 00:34:57,314
Really?

560
00:34:58,783 --> 00:35:01,251
Wow, so, the ecstasy
night, that actually.

561
00:35:01,284 --> 00:35:02,654
Yeah, he had a girlfriend.

562
00:35:02,687 --> 00:35:04,287
Whoa.

563
00:35:04,321 --> 00:35:06,523
I know, it was not ideal.

564
00:35:07,792 --> 00:35:10,728
I randomly think
of her sometimes.

565
00:35:10,762 --> 00:35:12,396
She was a nice person,

566
00:35:12,429 --> 00:35:14,699
she didn't deserve that.

567
00:35:14,732 --> 00:35:17,367
I wouldn't say she was
totally innocent either.

568
00:35:17,401 --> 00:35:18,936
What do you mean?

569
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:21,505
I think she had a little of
that same thing going on,

570
00:35:21,538 --> 00:35:23,708
with his previous girlfriend.

571
00:35:23,741 --> 00:35:26,376
What, like he was with
someone when he met Jen?

572
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,845
Yeah, I think so,

573
00:35:28,913 --> 00:35:30,715
I don't remember all the details

574
00:35:30,748 --> 00:35:32,617
but there was this girl Zoe

575
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:35,519
and then the Jen thing
happened really fast,

576
00:35:35,553 --> 00:35:38,288
a little bit too fast, you know.

577
00:35:39,991 --> 00:35:42,259
No, I didn't know that.

578
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:46,898
Oh.

579
00:35:50,935 --> 00:35:53,503
Look man, I just meant,

580
00:35:53,537 --> 00:35:57,340
you shouldn't feel bad
anybody Jen, you know.

581
00:35:58,843 --> 00:36:00,778
It's fine.

582
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,582
I don't even know what
I'm talking about,

583
00:36:04,615 --> 00:36:06,784
this was like 10 years ago.

584
00:36:07,919 --> 00:36:11,789
It's okay, let's
just keep going.

585
00:36:43,654 --> 00:36:44,722
Hey.

586
00:36:46,389 --> 00:36:47,992
They did pretty good.

587
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:55,767
You can keep
sleeping, I'll finish.

588
00:37:31,736 --> 00:37:32,603
Charlie.

589
00:37:35,505 --> 00:37:38,408
Tell me that's not a camera.

590
00:37:38,441 --> 00:37:40,477
No fucking way.

591
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,079
I'm gonna call the cops.

592
00:37:42,113 --> 00:37:43,614
Wait, wait.

593
00:37:43,648 --> 00:37:45,917
What, where are you going?

594
00:37:56,393 --> 00:37:57,394
Fuck.
No.

595
00:38:04,802 --> 00:38:08,005
We can't call the cops.
What, why?

596
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:09,841
It's all on camera.

597
00:38:10,808 --> 00:38:11,943
If we report this,

598
00:38:11,976 --> 00:38:15,545
then Michelle and Josh they
could find out everything.

599
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:18,649
So, what, we just let this
fucking racist pervert,

600
00:38:18,683 --> 00:38:19,617
get away with it?

601
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:23,888
I don't know, I don't
know, let me think.

602
00:38:23,921 --> 00:38:27,725
Ew, just thinking of
him jacking off to it.

603
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:43,506
I think, we pretend
like it didn't happen.

604
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,877
What?
What are our other options?

605
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:48,145
I don't know, threaten him
to give us the footage.

606
00:38:48,179 --> 00:38:49,747
I'm pretty sure threatening him

607
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,082
is the best way to ensure

608
00:38:51,115 --> 00:38:55,186
that he shows Michelle
and Josh everything.

609
00:38:55,219 --> 00:38:56,888
Fucking kill him.

610
00:38:59,123 --> 00:39:02,860
Okay, clearly we
can't stay the night,

611
00:39:02,894 --> 00:39:04,962
so, we just need to
think of a reason

612
00:39:04,996 --> 00:39:09,466
to tell Josh and Michelle
why we're leaving early,

613
00:39:09,499 --> 00:39:11,035
like, Taylor came by and
said some racist shit

614
00:39:11,068 --> 00:39:11,969
or something like that.

615
00:39:12,003 --> 00:39:13,503
You know how protective Josh is,

616
00:39:13,536 --> 00:39:14,906
he wouldn't leave
without confronting him.

617
00:39:14,939 --> 00:39:16,073
Yeah but, I'll deal with Josh.

618
00:39:16,107 --> 00:39:17,041
No, no, no, no,
we start telling.

619
00:39:17,074 --> 00:39:17,708
We'll figure it out.

620
00:39:17,742 --> 00:39:18,943
We start telling more lies,

621
00:39:18,976 --> 00:39:20,645
it just gets messy.

622
00:39:22,847 --> 00:39:24,649
Oh, come on.

623
00:39:26,684 --> 00:39:27,919
It's gonna be okay.

624
00:39:27,952 --> 00:39:29,787
So, we do nothing,

625
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,621
is that what you're saying?

626
00:39:30,655 --> 00:39:31,722
He can't show
anyone the footage,

627
00:39:31,756 --> 00:39:32,657
or else he gets caught,

628
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:36,227
he's the only one who's
ever gonna see it.

629
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,094
We get through the night,

630
00:39:37,128 --> 00:39:40,631
we leave first thing
in the morning,

631
00:39:40,665 --> 00:39:41,866
never happened.

632
00:39:51,742 --> 00:39:55,713
Hey, thought we almost
lost you guys out there.

633
00:39:55,746 --> 00:39:59,150
Someone got tan and sexy.
Oh yeah?

634
00:39:59,183 --> 00:40:01,085
Yeah.

635
00:40:01,118 --> 00:40:02,053
Did you have fun?

636
00:40:02,086 --> 00:40:03,955
Hey, missed you boo.

637
00:40:11,295 --> 00:40:13,664
Is everything okay?

638
00:40:13,698 --> 00:40:14,531
Yeah.

639
00:40:14,565 --> 00:40:15,967
What's going on?

640
00:40:17,201 --> 00:40:19,170
You know what, let me
get out of these clothes,

641
00:40:19,203 --> 00:40:20,738
hop into the shower

642
00:40:20,771 --> 00:40:22,840
and I will regale you with
the heartwarming tale,

643
00:40:22,873 --> 00:40:24,041
that was our hike.

644
00:40:24,075 --> 00:40:25,743
Oh, you're gonna take a shower?

645
00:40:25,776 --> 00:40:27,611
Yeah, can't you smell me.

646
00:40:27,645 --> 00:40:28,446
No, I don't know,

647
00:40:28,478 --> 00:40:31,816
I just, I get turned
on by your mess.

648
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:33,184
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

649
00:40:34,618 --> 00:40:35,753
Okay.

650
00:40:39,957 --> 00:40:42,560
What's going on?

651
00:40:42,593 --> 00:40:43,294
What do you mean?

652
00:40:43,327 --> 00:40:45,863
I don't know, are you okay?

653
00:40:48,866 --> 00:40:50,067
Where you and Zoe broken up

654
00:40:50,101 --> 00:40:53,104
when you started dating Jen?

655
00:40:53,137 --> 00:40:54,005
What?

656
00:40:55,172 --> 00:40:57,241
Where's this coming from?

657
00:41:00,711 --> 00:41:01,579
Hello.

658
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:07,318
I don't remember exactly
how it played out

659
00:41:07,351 --> 00:41:10,321
but yeah, there may
have been a situation

660
00:41:10,354 --> 00:41:12,189
where we hung out
for the first time,

661
00:41:12,223 --> 00:41:15,226
while I was breaking
up with Zoe.

662
00:41:15,259 --> 00:41:16,327
So, when you met Jen,

663
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,661
you were definitely
still with Zoe?

664
00:41:17,695 --> 00:41:19,563
I think so, you know,

665
00:41:19,597 --> 00:41:22,133
but what is happening right now?

666
00:41:24,769 --> 00:41:27,271
I was just thinking about us

667
00:41:27,304 --> 00:41:30,341
and the circumstances in
which we got together,

668
00:41:30,374 --> 00:41:32,243
and I thought it
was funny to hear

669
00:41:32,276 --> 00:41:35,613
that you have a
pattern of doing this.

670
00:41:36,714 --> 00:41:38,349
Okay, so, this is a
conversation you had

671
00:41:38,382 --> 00:41:40,051
with Josh, I assume.

672
00:41:40,084 --> 00:41:42,119
What exactly did my
fucking brother say?

673
00:41:42,153 --> 00:41:42,820
Don't do that.
No,

674
00:41:42,853 --> 00:41:45,022
it tickles me to think that Josh

675
00:41:45,056 --> 00:41:47,158
has been keeping such close tabs

676
00:41:47,191 --> 00:41:48,959
on my dating history.

677
00:41:50,227 --> 00:41:51,629
I just wonder why you
would've lied to me

678
00:41:51,662 --> 00:41:52,696
about it at the time.

679
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:53,798
I don't think I lied to you,

680
00:41:53,831 --> 00:41:55,166
I don't remember the details.

681
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:59,070
Whatever I said at the
time was probably true.

682
00:42:07,778 --> 00:42:11,582
Migrate to the nesting beach.

683
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:19,023
Okay, no, we're not doing this.

684
00:42:20,691 --> 00:42:23,694
This is not how
this trip is ending.

685
00:42:24,762 --> 00:42:26,964
We're gonna do drugs,

686
00:42:26,997 --> 00:42:28,132
we're gonna have fun.

687
00:42:28,165 --> 00:42:29,767
Mina, let's do it.

688
00:42:30,968 --> 00:42:32,269
Sorry.

689
00:42:32,303 --> 00:42:34,071
But you guys should
totally do whatever,

690
00:42:34,105 --> 00:42:35,306
don't let me stop you.

691
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:36,040
Actually, you know, I think,

692
00:42:36,073 --> 00:42:38,342
I'm gonna sit this one out too.

693
00:42:38,375 --> 00:42:41,779
No, get up, get up, we said.

694
00:42:41,812 --> 00:42:43,848
Babe, what if we had
a more mellow night,

695
00:42:43,881 --> 00:42:46,951
played some board
games or something?

696
00:42:48,953 --> 00:42:51,755
You know what, go ahead

697
00:42:51,789 --> 00:42:53,190
and waste your last night.

698
00:42:53,224 --> 00:42:55,326
I thought we came here
to have a good time

699
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,394
and that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

700
00:42:57,428 --> 00:42:58,929
Where's the molly?

701
00:42:58,963 --> 00:43:00,064
Don't tell me you
guys finished it

702
00:43:00,097 --> 00:43:01,132
or I will fucking.

703
00:43:01,165 --> 00:43:02,333
It's on the side, by the bar.

704
00:43:02,366 --> 00:43:04,101
There's plenty left.

705
00:43:14,445 --> 00:43:16,380
You sure you wanna do this?

706
00:43:16,413 --> 00:43:17,114
This was the plan.

707
00:43:17,148 --> 00:43:18,449
I went to bed early last night,

708
00:43:18,482 --> 00:43:19,750
so I can do this tonight,

709
00:43:19,783 --> 00:43:21,185
so, yes, I'm sure.

710
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:23,787
Okay.

711
00:43:24,722 --> 00:43:25,389
Okay.

712
00:43:43,941 --> 00:43:44,808
Reg?

713
00:43:49,246 --> 00:43:51,650
Hey, you guys, where's Reggie?

714
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,987
Baby, I'm so sorry.

715
00:43:57,021 --> 00:43:58,422
I was just so out
of it this morning,

716
00:43:58,455 --> 00:44:00,090
completely forgot.

717
00:44:00,124 --> 00:44:01,926
What's going on?

718
00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:04,195
Cool, good to know.

719
00:44:04,228 --> 00:44:06,030
No, no, no, no, no.

720
00:44:07,097 --> 00:44:07,932
Reg.

721
00:44:09,767 --> 00:44:10,434
Reggie.

722
00:44:11,402 --> 00:44:13,370
Okay, he's gotta be
around here somewhere.

723
00:44:13,404 --> 00:44:14,872
Fuck.
Josh, it's all right,

724
00:44:14,905 --> 00:44:15,839
we'll find him.

725
00:44:15,873 --> 00:44:17,208
Let's spread out.

726
00:44:17,241 --> 00:44:20,411
What if he fell off
the side of the cliff?

727
00:44:20,444 --> 00:44:21,812
Fuck.

728
00:44:21,845 --> 00:44:23,247
Reggie.
Reggie.

729
00:44:25,482 --> 00:44:26,350
Reggie.

730
00:44:27,985 --> 00:44:30,321
Oh fuck, they lost the dog.

731
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:34,191
Reggie.
Reggie.

732
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,161
Reggie.
Reg.

733
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:41,398
Reggie.

734
00:44:44,435 --> 00:44:45,436
Reggie.

735
00:44:45,469 --> 00:44:46,904
Reggie.

736
00:44:46,937 --> 00:44:47,838
Hey Reg.

737
00:44:49,373 --> 00:44:51,909
Come on Reg.

738
00:44:51,942 --> 00:44:53,177
Reggie.

739
00:45:04,221 --> 00:45:05,456
Any luck?

740
00:45:05,489 --> 00:45:07,424
No, it's too dark,

741
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:08,993
we got no phones.

742
00:45:10,261 --> 00:45:11,128
Hey, did you forget to turn off

743
00:45:11,161 --> 00:45:14,131
the hot tub, last
night, it's broken?

744
00:45:14,164 --> 00:45:15,132
I don't know, maybe.

745
00:45:15,165 --> 00:45:18,202
Well, whatever, I called Taylor.

746
00:45:18,235 --> 00:45:19,937
What, why?

747
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:22,273
Well because it's not working

748
00:45:22,306 --> 00:45:24,808
and I would like it
to start working,

749
00:45:24,842 --> 00:45:26,310
so I can get in it.

750
00:45:27,579 --> 00:45:29,480
So, he's coming here right now?

751
00:45:29,513 --> 00:45:30,147
Yeah.

752
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:32,249
Who's coming over right now?

753
00:45:32,283 --> 00:45:35,352
Taylor's coming to
fix the hot tub.

754
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:40,057
Babe, I wish you'd told
me before you did that.

755
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:41,091
He's just gonna come and go,

756
00:45:41,125 --> 00:45:42,860
what's the big deal?

757
00:45:42,893 --> 00:45:43,861
I know, I just,

758
00:45:43,894 --> 00:45:47,131
I just know that Mina
doesn't like the guy.

759
00:45:47,164 --> 00:45:48,899
It's fine,

760
00:45:48,932 --> 00:45:50,334
I'm fine.

761
00:45:50,367 --> 00:45:52,336
It's fine, she's fine.

762
00:45:52,369 --> 00:45:53,837
Hey, what if he took him?

763
00:45:53,871 --> 00:45:56,307
What if who took, what?

764
00:45:56,340 --> 00:46:00,010
What is Taylor came
by and saw Reggie?

765
00:46:00,044 --> 00:46:03,113
You think Taylor took Reggie?

766
00:46:03,147 --> 00:46:05,149
Maybe.

767
00:46:05,182 --> 00:46:07,885
Well, I just don't think
he would agree to come by

768
00:46:07,918 --> 00:46:10,888
and help me, if he was
holding your dog hostage.

769
00:46:10,921 --> 00:46:11,790
I guess, we'll see.

770
00:46:11,822 --> 00:46:13,190
What are you gonna
straight up ask him?

771
00:46:13,223 --> 00:46:13,924
Yeah.

772
00:46:13,957 --> 00:46:14,759
I'm pretty sure he's gonna know

773
00:46:14,793 --> 00:46:16,226
that we snuck a
dog into his house,

774
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:17,227
if you ask him about it.

775
00:46:17,261 --> 00:46:19,196
My fucking dog is missing, okay.

776
00:46:19,229 --> 00:46:22,833
If he knows something,
I'm gonna find out.

777
00:46:38,315 --> 00:46:39,316
He's here.

778
00:46:40,618 --> 00:46:41,485
Finally.

779
00:46:46,123 --> 00:46:47,324
Hey, evening buddy.

780
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:51,228
Hey, where you at the
house, at all, today?

781
00:46:51,261 --> 00:46:52,529
No, not today.

782
00:46:53,598 --> 00:46:55,299
Yeah, I've been at
my place all day,

783
00:46:55,332 --> 00:46:57,301
on the couch with my bottle.

784
00:46:57,334 --> 00:46:58,135
Is that right?

785
00:46:58,168 --> 00:46:59,571
That is correct.

786
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,475
Is that white girl here?

787
00:47:04,508 --> 00:47:06,578
She called about the tub.

788
00:47:08,178 --> 00:47:10,047
Did you take my dog?

789
00:47:12,983 --> 00:47:14,184
What?

790
00:47:14,218 --> 00:47:16,019
Did you take my dog?

791
00:47:16,053 --> 00:47:17,388
No, I heard what
you said partner,

792
00:47:17,421 --> 00:47:19,056
I'm just trying to figure out

793
00:47:19,089 --> 00:47:21,258
why you got a dog in
here, in the first place.

794
00:47:21,291 --> 00:47:24,596
Why don't you just
answer the question?

795
00:47:26,497 --> 00:47:28,899
No, didn't take your dog.

796
00:47:33,203 --> 00:47:34,071
Hey, hi,

797
00:47:35,372 --> 00:47:36,440
I called you.

798
00:47:37,474 --> 00:47:39,343
Full disclosure, I'm on drugs,

799
00:47:39,376 --> 00:47:41,412
I would just love to
get in that hot tub

800
00:47:41,445 --> 00:47:43,681
as soon as humanly possible.

801
00:47:43,715 --> 00:47:44,582
Thank you.

802
00:47:50,187 --> 00:47:54,592
She probably shouldn't be
out there, alone with him.

803
00:47:58,429 --> 00:48:01,031
Baby, what are you thinking?

804
00:48:02,232 --> 00:48:05,002
I don't know what
to fucking think.

805
00:48:05,035 --> 00:48:06,303
What can I do?

806
00:48:07,371 --> 00:48:08,205
Let's just find Reggie,

807
00:48:08,238 --> 00:48:11,241
get the fuck out
of here, all right.

808
00:48:19,784 --> 00:48:20,718
What the?

809
00:48:22,519 --> 00:48:24,188
All right, hold on.

810
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:30,227
Yeah.

811
00:48:36,568 --> 00:48:37,669
Yeah.

812
00:48:37,702 --> 00:48:39,771
Program was stuck
in cleaning mode,

813
00:48:39,804 --> 00:48:41,338
should be good to go now.

814
00:48:41,371 --> 00:48:42,607
Oh, thank you so much,

815
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,108
you're a lifesaver.

816
00:48:45,142 --> 00:48:47,579
Well, enjoy your final night.

817
00:48:49,046 --> 00:48:50,715
Thank you.

818
00:48:52,483 --> 00:48:55,285
Stay with me, 'til it warms up.

819
00:49:00,558 --> 00:49:01,559
Reggie.

820
00:49:01,593 --> 00:49:04,394
Come here boy, Reg.

821
00:49:04,428 --> 00:49:05,295
Reggie.

822
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:09,567
Reggie.

823
00:49:12,302 --> 00:49:13,170
Hey.

824
00:49:15,439 --> 00:49:17,374
Hope you find your dog.

825
00:49:18,475 --> 00:49:20,177
I got two of 'em myself.

826
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:22,045
That whole, no dogs policy,

827
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:23,615
is my brothers idea.

828
00:49:24,515 --> 00:49:28,418
Don't worry, I'm not
gonna rat you out.

829
00:49:28,452 --> 00:49:30,722
I know how to keep a secret.

830
00:49:32,857 --> 00:49:35,693
Well, if there's
not anything else.

831
00:49:35,727 --> 00:49:39,229
Actually, can I show you
one last thing, real quick?

832
00:49:39,263 --> 00:49:40,130
Yep.

833
00:49:44,301 --> 00:49:45,637
Oh, let me guess,

834
00:49:46,503 --> 00:49:48,272
it's that toilet hah?

835
00:49:51,308 --> 00:49:52,844
Yeah, you gotta hold
that flusher down,

836
00:49:52,877 --> 00:49:55,312
a lot longer than you think.

837
00:49:56,513 --> 00:49:57,548
I just want you to know

838
00:49:57,582 --> 00:49:59,717
that if you ever do
anything with that footage,

839
00:49:59,751 --> 00:50:01,753
we go right to the cops.

840
00:50:05,155 --> 00:50:06,591
Excuse me?

841
00:50:06,624 --> 00:50:08,693
We know, okay.

842
00:50:08,726 --> 00:50:10,394
Look, I don't really know
what's happening right now,

843
00:50:10,427 --> 00:50:12,095
what are you doing?

844
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:16,533
Jesus, you gonna make me
actually fucking do this?

845
00:50:16,568 --> 00:50:17,434
What?

846
00:50:26,878 --> 00:50:28,780
What the hell is that?

847
00:50:28,813 --> 00:50:31,649
Dude, we fucking got you.

848
00:50:31,683 --> 00:50:33,818
Look, I don't know what
scam you're trying to pull,

849
00:50:33,851 --> 00:50:35,519
but you go ahead
and call the police.

850
00:50:35,553 --> 00:50:36,520
Are you listening to me?

851
00:50:36,554 --> 00:50:37,822
I didn't have nothing
to do with that shit.

852
00:50:37,855 --> 00:50:39,122
I'm giving you a fucking out,

853
00:50:39,156 --> 00:50:40,324
we could've turned
you in already.

854
00:50:40,357 --> 00:50:42,292
You know what, how about I
call the police for you, hah?

855
00:50:42,326 --> 00:50:43,027
What?

856
00:50:43,061 --> 00:50:43,995
No, that's not what I'm saying.

857
00:50:44,028 --> 00:50:45,597
Hey, hey, hey.
That's not what I'm saying.

858
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:46,496
Reggie.

859
00:50:51,936 --> 00:50:55,272
Stop, don't be stupid.
You motherfuckers.

860
00:50:55,305 --> 00:50:56,206
Baby.

861
00:51:01,445 --> 00:51:03,581
Josh, stop.

862
00:51:03,615 --> 00:51:05,415
Josh, that's enough.

863
00:51:05,449 --> 00:51:06,316
Stop.

864
00:51:12,924 --> 00:51:14,659
That's enough.

865
00:51:14,692 --> 00:51:15,525
Hey,

866
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,361
hey, hey, hey, hey.

867
00:51:17,394 --> 00:51:18,261
Come here.

868
00:51:46,724 --> 00:51:47,759
He was about to call the cops

869
00:51:47,792 --> 00:51:50,695
and I freaked out and it
just escalated, I'm sorry.

870
00:51:50,728 --> 00:51:52,295
Fuck, fuck.

871
00:51:52,329 --> 00:51:52,964
We're so fucked.

872
00:51:52,997 --> 00:51:54,799
What are we gonna do?

873
00:51:56,333 --> 00:51:57,902
What just happened?

874
00:52:01,471 --> 00:52:02,339
You guys?

875
00:52:09,346 --> 00:52:11,348
He was filming us.

876
00:52:11,381 --> 00:52:12,784
What?

877
00:52:12,817 --> 00:52:15,687
I was taking a shower earlier

878
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,855
and I saw something weird,

879
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:20,591
like a camera,

880
00:52:20,625 --> 00:52:22,392
but I didn't know for sure

881
00:52:22,426 --> 00:52:23,928
and I just, I felt
really scared,

882
00:52:23,961 --> 00:52:25,362
I didn't know what to do.

883
00:52:25,395 --> 00:52:26,597
And while I was
dealing with that,

884
00:52:26,631 --> 00:52:28,231
you guys got back to the place

885
00:52:28,265 --> 00:52:30,735
and I was just gonna let it go.

886
00:52:32,502 --> 00:52:33,771
I was hoping it wasn't real,

887
00:52:33,805 --> 00:52:35,405
but then when Taylor came by,

888
00:52:35,439 --> 00:52:36,506
I couldn't hold back

889
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:38,609
and I confronted him and.

890
00:52:40,277 --> 00:52:42,479
It definitely was a camera.

891
00:52:44,281 --> 00:52:46,818
And then Josh heard us fighting.

892
00:52:48,385 --> 00:52:49,386
I fucked up.

893
00:52:51,789 --> 00:52:52,690
I'm so sorry,

894
00:52:52,724 --> 00:52:53,858
I should've just said
something to you,

895
00:52:53,891 --> 00:52:55,258
I should've told you.

896
00:52:55,292 --> 00:52:56,627
It's all right.

897
00:52:59,797 --> 00:53:02,867
Oh my God, did you
find any others?

898
00:53:19,751 --> 00:53:21,753
Yes, I'm fucking disgusted,
he was watching us,

899
00:53:21,786 --> 00:53:24,521
but we have to
call an ambulance.

900
00:53:24,555 --> 00:53:26,356
What are we gonna tell him?

901
00:53:26,389 --> 00:53:28,291
He beat him to a pulp.

902
00:53:28,325 --> 00:53:30,895
I'm sorry, Josh, there's
no way around it.

903
00:53:30,928 --> 00:53:32,529
He was attacking
her when I came in.

904
00:53:32,563 --> 00:53:35,298
I know, but it's all on camera.

905
00:53:35,332 --> 00:53:36,234
Once they see that footage,

906
00:53:36,266 --> 00:53:38,069
I don't think the
self defense argument

907
00:53:38,102 --> 00:53:39,536
is gonna hold up.

908
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:41,505
He's a racist piece of shit

909
00:53:41,538 --> 00:53:45,308
who was filming us in
the shower, all right.

910
00:53:45,342 --> 00:53:47,578
I didn't do anything wrong.

911
00:53:47,612 --> 00:53:48,813
Go ahead, call.

912
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:58,488
I'm gonna check on Taylor.

913
00:54:04,662 --> 00:54:06,597
It wasn't your fault.

914
00:54:09,033 --> 00:54:12,570
I was just trying to
protect you, you know.

915
00:54:12,603 --> 00:54:13,470
I know.

916
00:54:19,677 --> 00:54:21,679
Michelle wait.

917
00:54:21,712 --> 00:54:22,580
What?

918
00:54:23,513 --> 00:54:25,315
He's not breathing.

919
00:54:38,696 --> 00:54:40,363
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

920
00:54:54,879 --> 00:54:56,948
Look, he was fine, just
a second ago, right,

921
00:54:56,981 --> 00:54:58,115
I didn't even.

922
00:55:00,117 --> 00:55:02,720
How did he even die from that?

923
00:55:07,490 --> 00:55:08,759
What do we do?

924
00:55:11,128 --> 00:55:12,797
What do you mean?

925
00:55:13,798 --> 00:55:18,870
I mean, like, what do
we do, I don't know?

926
00:55:18,903 --> 00:55:20,872
We have to call the police.

927
00:55:20,905 --> 00:55:22,573
We can't do that.

928
00:55:23,774 --> 00:55:25,176
It's different now.

929
00:55:25,209 --> 00:55:26,677
Yeah, he's fucking dead.

930
00:55:26,711 --> 00:55:27,945
Exactly, the second we call in,

931
00:55:27,979 --> 00:55:29,780
they're sending Josh
straight back to jail.

932
00:55:29,814 --> 00:55:30,915
They're not gonna
go easy on him.

933
00:55:30,948 --> 00:55:33,450
Josh killed a man.

934
00:55:33,483 --> 00:55:34,417
Are you grasping this?

935
00:55:34,451 --> 00:55:36,453
This is actually happening.
I know, I know,

936
00:55:36,486 --> 00:55:37,788
but I do not wanna
see my little brother

937
00:55:37,822 --> 00:55:40,825
go to jail for the
rest of his life.

938
00:55:44,562 --> 00:55:48,431
There's gotta be
something we can do.

939
00:55:48,465 --> 00:55:49,466
Like what?

940
00:55:52,036 --> 00:55:53,436
I don't know,

941
00:55:56,073 --> 00:55:58,776
like what if it was an accident?

942
00:56:01,112 --> 00:56:01,979
What?

943
00:56:05,548 --> 00:56:09,220
He had a shit ton of
alcohol in his system right?

944
00:56:09,253 --> 00:56:11,454
Like, who's to say
he didn't just,

945
00:56:11,488 --> 00:56:13,224
drunkenly stumble
over the cliff.

946
00:56:13,257 --> 00:56:14,959
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

947
00:56:14,992 --> 00:56:15,993
He had a few too many

948
00:56:16,027 --> 00:56:17,895
and he came to clean up
the place after we left,

949
00:56:17,929 --> 00:56:19,130
and he slipped.

950
00:56:21,098 --> 00:56:24,168
We are not having
his conversation.

951
00:56:28,806 --> 00:56:31,876
Michelle called
him from her phone,

952
00:56:32,743 --> 00:56:34,477
they can track that.

953
00:56:39,549 --> 00:56:41,085
Right, but the call logs
don't actually prove

954
00:56:41,118 --> 00:56:43,020
that we ever saw him.

955
00:56:43,054 --> 00:56:45,256
I mean, there's a million
reasons she could've called him.

956
00:56:45,289 --> 00:56:46,924
This is fucking crazy.

957
00:56:46,958 --> 00:56:47,992
What about the footage,

958
00:56:48,025 --> 00:56:49,560
it's all on tape.

959
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:59,236
I don't know, I guess we have
to get to rid of it somehow.

960
00:56:59,270 --> 00:57:01,605
The camera was wireless.

961
00:57:02,807 --> 00:57:04,608
Those things don't
have that much range,

962
00:57:04,642 --> 00:57:09,013
the receiver's probably
somewhere in this house.

963
00:57:09,046 --> 00:57:10,513
No.

964
00:57:11,983 --> 00:57:13,851
Babe this could work.

965
00:57:13,884 --> 00:57:16,253
I'm not saying we
can't get away with it,

966
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:18,756
I'm saying I don't want
to get away with it.

967
00:57:18,789 --> 00:57:19,690
We will take care of everything,

968
00:57:19,724 --> 00:57:21,792
you wouldn't have to
be involved at all.

969
00:57:21,826 --> 00:57:23,094
You're not listening to me,

970
00:57:23,127 --> 00:57:24,228
I'm not gonna live
the rest of my life,

971
00:57:24,261 --> 00:57:25,763
knowing that we killed some guy

972
00:57:25,796 --> 00:57:28,531
and didn't do anything about it.

973
00:57:57,328 --> 00:57:58,195
Three.

974
00:58:45,309 --> 00:58:49,113
I just came to say,
we'll be outside.

975
00:58:49,146 --> 00:58:49,814
I won't say anymore,

976
00:58:49,847 --> 00:58:53,317
you had nothing to do with this.

977
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:55,152
I'm already guilty.

978
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:57,388
No you aren't,

979
00:58:57,421 --> 00:59:00,091
you didn't do anything.

980
00:59:00,124 --> 00:59:03,094
I didn't call the police.

981
00:59:03,127 --> 00:59:05,696
If we get caught, I'm
an accomplice to murder,

982
00:59:05,729 --> 00:59:07,665
just like you and Mina.

983
00:59:16,807 --> 00:59:19,810
We can say you
weren't even here.

984
00:59:19,844 --> 00:59:21,345
Just go, go do
what you need to do

985
00:59:21,378 --> 00:59:23,647
so we can get outta here.

986
00:59:26,117 --> 00:59:30,054
It'll be over soon, I promise.

987
00:59:30,087 --> 00:59:32,223
This will never be over.

988
01:00:19,937 --> 01:00:22,406
Okay, okay, you ready?
Yeah.

989
01:00:37,988 --> 01:00:38,856
Fuck.

990
01:00:41,926 --> 01:00:42,793
Fuck.

991
01:01:35,145 --> 01:01:38,816
Okay on three, one, two, three.

992
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:30,834
What the fuck are you doing?

993
01:02:30,868 --> 01:02:33,237
Josh, don't.

994
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:35,139
You crazy?

995
01:02:35,172 --> 01:02:37,474
I killed him, all right.

996
01:02:37,508 --> 01:02:39,843
I'm not letting you two go
to jail 'cause I fucked up,

997
01:02:39,877 --> 01:02:41,078
just let me finish this.

998
01:02:41,111 --> 01:02:43,247
Baby, it's not worth it.

999
01:02:44,616 --> 01:02:45,816
It's okay.

1000
01:02:47,985 --> 01:02:51,221
All right, it's
okay, just let go.

1001
01:02:51,255 --> 01:02:53,190
Let go, it's all right.

1002
01:03:00,565 --> 01:03:02,533
Please be careful.

1003
01:03:02,567 --> 01:03:03,434
Go slow.

1004
01:03:24,622 --> 01:03:27,625
Shit, use your
light, mine's dead.

1005
01:03:46,310 --> 01:03:47,177
Josh.

1006
01:04:03,093 --> 01:04:05,295
Are you okay?
You okay, J?

1007
01:04:08,566 --> 01:04:09,967
I'm okay.

1008
01:04:19,744 --> 01:04:21,211
See you in hell.

1009
01:05:07,057 --> 01:05:08,192
Here.

1010
01:05:13,363 --> 01:05:14,431
Are you okay?

1011
01:05:16,133 --> 01:05:17,000
Jesus.

1012
01:05:22,506 --> 01:05:25,710
Let's just find that
fucking footage.

1013
01:05:41,659 --> 01:05:43,060
Stop, what are you doing.

1014
01:05:43,093 --> 01:05:44,061
Stop.

1015
01:05:44,094 --> 01:05:45,362
Stop the car.

1016
01:05:45,395 --> 01:05:47,130
Where are you going?

1017
01:05:56,106 --> 01:05:57,307
I know, I know.

1018
01:05:59,510 --> 01:06:00,344
The worst part is over.

1019
01:06:00,377 --> 01:06:03,247
Just one last, tiny thing.

1020
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:04,081
I saw you.

1021
01:06:05,215 --> 01:06:07,217
You saw, what are
you talking about?

1022
01:06:07,251 --> 01:06:08,452
You and Mina.

1023
01:06:15,192 --> 01:06:16,126
Okay, listen, I fucked up,

1024
01:06:16,159 --> 01:06:16,794
that was a huge mistake,

1025
01:06:16,828 --> 01:06:19,363
it didn't mean anything.

1026
01:06:19,396 --> 01:06:20,798
Baby, please, I'm
so sorry, I'm so.

1027
01:06:20,832 --> 01:06:22,567
I can't even fucking
look at you, right now.

1028
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,067
Baby please, I'm
sorry, let me explain,

1029
01:06:24,101 --> 01:06:25,003
let me explain please.

1030
01:06:25,035 --> 01:06:27,572
Will you look at me
please baby, please.

1031
01:06:27,605 --> 01:06:28,472
Please.

1032
01:06:31,643 --> 01:06:35,647
Okay, first off, where
did you find the footage?

1033
01:06:39,349 --> 01:06:40,484
Who are you?

1034
01:06:42,654 --> 01:06:45,188
Wait, wait, wait.

1035
01:06:57,401 --> 01:06:59,503
Hey, hey what just happened?

1036
01:06:59,536 --> 01:07:00,605
Where's she going?

1037
01:07:00,638 --> 01:07:01,305
She hit her limit

1038
01:07:01,338 --> 01:07:02,840
and she couldn't take anymore.

1039
01:07:02,874 --> 01:07:03,708
What does that mean?

1040
01:07:03,741 --> 01:07:04,742
Is she going to the cops?

1041
01:07:04,776 --> 01:07:06,510
No, she just had to go.

1042
01:07:06,543 --> 01:07:07,712
Wait, wait, wait,
is she coming back?

1043
01:07:07,745 --> 01:07:10,414
Hey, how are we
gonna get outta here?

1044
01:07:10,447 --> 01:07:11,381
Hey.

1045
01:07:11,415 --> 01:07:13,517
Look, this is not okay,
Charlie, all right,

1046
01:07:13,551 --> 01:07:15,319
stop being so fucking calm.

1047
01:07:15,352 --> 01:07:16,186
Everything is fine.

1048
01:07:16,219 --> 01:07:18,288
Look, we just, we
stick to the plan,

1049
01:07:18,322 --> 01:07:19,289
we find the footage

1050
01:07:19,323 --> 01:07:22,794
and then we figure out
how to get outta here.

1051
01:07:50,287 --> 01:07:51,488
Fuck.

1052
01:08:15,847 --> 01:08:17,180
What the fuck?

1053
01:09:32,590 --> 01:09:35,827
Guys, Michelle's in trouble.

1054
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:39,329
She's down the road,
I'll be right back.

1055
01:09:49,372 --> 01:09:50,240
Babe.

1056
01:09:52,777 --> 01:09:53,644
Babe.

1057
01:10:07,357 --> 01:10:08,025
Michelle.

1058
01:10:21,839 --> 01:10:23,808
Oh, thank God.

1059
01:10:23,841 --> 01:10:27,444
Jesus, boo, you scared
the shit out of me.

1060
01:11:16,894 --> 01:11:19,429
What do you see?

1061
01:11:19,462 --> 01:11:22,066
Just a bunch of boxes and junk.

1062
01:11:30,174 --> 01:11:33,543
It's gotta be here somewhere.

1063
01:11:33,578 --> 01:11:35,847
This is so fucked up.

1064
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:37,615
Just help me look.

1065
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:42,419
Are we sure we even know
what we're looking for?

1066
01:11:42,452 --> 01:11:45,122
A computer, hard drive,

1067
01:11:45,156 --> 01:11:46,691
router, anything.

1068
01:11:54,665 --> 01:11:55,532
Oh, Jesus.

1069
01:11:56,433 --> 01:11:58,569
What, what is it?

1070
01:12:00,738 --> 01:12:02,940
Oh, you don't wanna know.

1071
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:10,681
Anything?

1072
01:12:11,883 --> 01:12:12,750
No.

1073
01:12:17,889 --> 01:12:21,692
Part of me expected to
find a control room,

1074
01:12:24,595 --> 01:12:27,865
a whole bunch of TV
monitors, something.

1075
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,001
It's okay.

1076
01:12:31,168 --> 01:12:33,170
Let's just keep looking.

1077
01:12:35,573 --> 01:12:38,508
I'm such a fucking
piece of shit.

1078
01:12:40,543 --> 01:12:44,181
I don't know what the
fucks wrong with me.

1079
01:12:44,215 --> 01:12:47,551
You know, and I
dragged you into this.

1080
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,453
No, you didn't.

1081
01:12:54,158 --> 01:12:56,694
We're gonna get through this.

1082
01:12:59,096 --> 01:13:01,565
I just need a minute here.

1083
01:13:04,769 --> 01:13:06,170
I'll be outside.

1084
01:13:32,296 --> 01:13:33,164
Baby.

1085
01:13:40,805 --> 01:13:41,672
Charlie.

1086
01:13:54,285 --> 01:13:55,820
Are you okay?

1087
01:13:55,853 --> 01:13:57,788
Not really.

1088
01:13:57,822 --> 01:14:01,225
What are you thinking?

1089
01:14:09,734 --> 01:14:13,204
Hey, baby, can I
show you something.

1090
01:14:13,237 --> 01:14:14,105
Did you find it?

1091
01:14:14,138 --> 01:14:16,140
No, no, it's not that,

1092
01:14:18,342 --> 01:14:21,812
I just got this weird
text from Charlie.

1093
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:25,016
What did he say?

1094
01:14:25,049 --> 01:14:26,250
Are you okay?

1095
01:14:26,283 --> 01:14:28,052
Not really.

1096
01:14:28,085 --> 01:14:30,321
What are you thinking?

1097
01:14:30,354 --> 01:14:33,324
We're smarter than this.

1098
01:14:33,357 --> 01:14:35,192
What is this?

1099
01:14:35,226 --> 01:14:36,694
I don't know.

1100
01:14:36,727 --> 01:14:38,162
It can never happen again.

1101
01:14:38,195 --> 01:14:41,732
I mean, this is you
and Charlie, right?

1102
01:14:41,766 --> 01:14:43,234
Yeah, I think so.

1103
01:14:44,235 --> 01:14:46,737
I mean, yes, but I don't.

1104
01:14:46,771 --> 01:14:49,173
What can never happen again?

1105
01:14:50,074 --> 01:14:50,941
What?

1106
01:14:52,176 --> 01:14:55,746
In the recording, you said,
"That can never happen again."

1107
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:58,049
What were you talking about?

1108
01:15:05,089 --> 01:15:06,557
What's going on?

1109
01:15:11,896 --> 01:15:13,631
How did Charlie get
this photo of you?

1110
01:15:13,664 --> 01:15:15,666
Why the fuck is he
sending this to me?

1111
01:15:15,699 --> 01:15:17,735
I don't know.

1112
01:15:17,768 --> 01:15:19,236
Don't look at that.

1113
01:15:22,039 --> 01:15:22,873
I'm sorry.

1114
01:15:25,643 --> 01:15:26,310
Charlie.

1115
01:15:27,411 --> 01:15:30,314
I'm gonna fucking
kill you Charlie.

1116
01:15:38,289 --> 01:15:40,157
You gonna send me this shit

1117
01:15:40,191 --> 01:15:42,059
and you're gonna hide?

1118
01:15:53,037 --> 01:15:53,904
Charlie.

1119
01:16:23,434 --> 01:16:24,301
Josh.

1120
01:22:38,509 --> 01:22:40,344
Come on in.

1121
01:22:40,377 --> 01:22:42,079
There's a bathroom there,

1122
01:22:42,112 --> 01:22:42,780
bedroom.

1123
01:22:51,154 --> 01:22:53,223
There's a beautiful view.

1124
01:23:00,197 --> 01:23:01,198
Wifi, Cable.

1125
01:23:05,502 --> 01:23:06,370
Enjoy.

1126
